## Dev Environment Settings

- Litium Cloud dev API base URL: `https://cloud-api-dev.litium.app`
- Use this URL with `set_context` by passing `cliUrl: "https://cloud-api-dev.litium.app"`
- Once set, all subsequent CLI actions run against the dev environment until you call `auth_logout` or change the context again.
