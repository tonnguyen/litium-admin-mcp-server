Host your MS SQL databases, offering easy integration with the Dotnet Web app. Pricing is determined by disk usage.

## Pricing

MS SQL is priced per hour based on usage. [Read more about prices](/cloud/serverless/private-apps-pricing)

## Installation

**Prerequirements**

- [CLI installed](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)
- [Access to the subscription where you want to create a new enviornment](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)
- [Environment created](/cloud/serverless/create-environment-new)

**Manifest**

Run following command to download file-storage manifest:

```powershell
litium-cloud marketplace manifest --app mssql-db -f enter-any-name.yaml
```

_Note, this will generate a yaml-file in the current folder you are in._

Example manifest file:

```powershell
kind: app
resource:
  id: mssql-db
spec:
  type: mssql-db
  version: 1.0.0
  # properties:
  #   # Sql backup artifact used when creating database.
  #   - name: backup_file
  #     value: artifacts/12345678901234567890123456789012
```

**Manifest configuration**

Id: Choose your own unique-per-environment id of the app. Suggested "mssql-db"

Properties: For MS SQL db it is possible to add a database artifact when installing, this backup will then be restored when database is created. [Read more about uploading a MS SQL backup](/cloud/serverless/artifacts-create-sql-backup-artifact) . It is also possible to omit the sql backup artifact property when creating the app. If no artifact is added the database will be empty once app is installed, and you may create tables through code with an dotnet web application connected to the ms sql db app. 

**Apply** 

Run following command to install the mssql-db app to environment:

```powershell
litium-cloud apply --subscription enter-subscription-id --environment enter-environment-id -f enter-yaml-filename
```

  
\- Fetch Subscription-id: litium-cloud subscription list  
\- Fetch Environment-id: litium-cloud environment list --subscription enter-subscription-id

_Note! After running the apply command, there will be a prompt with a job-id that you can use to [view status and logs of the job](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/view-status-and-logs)._

This will create a MS SQL Db app in the given environment. 

## Actions

_For a detailed list about which actions that are available use the following command:_

```powershell
litium-cloud marketplace show --app mssql-db --details --version add-version-here
```

### Backup database

Creates a database backup and stores the backup as an artifact for the current subscription. 

See the guide "[Create database backup](/cloud/serverless/create-database-backup)" of how to perform this action.

### Execute SQL Script

Use with care, especially when performing updates, as these may result in outdated cache data. Remember, you are responsible for the scripts you run.

For detailed instructions, see the guide "[Execute SQL script.](/cloud/serverless/execute-sql-script)"

### Execute database migration

This action enables entity framework migrations with a migration bundle, [read more about entity framework migrations and bundles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/applying?tabs=dotnet-core-cli#bundles).

Read more about how to execute this action.

## Connect with Dotnet Web app or Litium app

To be able to access your private MS SQL database from a Dotnet web app or your Litium app you should add configuration in your dotnet web or litium manifest file. 

Example configuration to connect a MS SQL app with id "privatedb" to your dotnet web app, note in this example the environment variable is named "connectionstrings\_\_defaultconnection", this would replace any value in appsettings.json in the section "ConnectionStrings->DefaultConnection". 

```powershell
configurations:
    - name: ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection
      valueFrom: 
        appRef:
          name: privatedb
          key: connection_string
```
