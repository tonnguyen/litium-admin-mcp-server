In Litium Serverless Cloud, you can run Node.js applications without the need for a specific framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js. Simply use the common nodejs-web app, which supports any type of Node.js application. The app relies on the build and start commands defined in the package.json file to manage the application's lifecycle.

## Pricing

Node.js Web is priced per hour based on selected app plan. [Read more about prices](/cloud/serverless/private-apps-pricing)

## Installation

**Prerequirements**

- [CLI installed](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)
- [Access to the subscription where you want to create a new enviornment](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)
- [Environment created](/cloud/serverless/create-environment-new)

## **Manifest**

Run following command to download file-storage manifest:

```powershell
litium-cloud marketplace manifest --app nodejs-web -f enter-any-name.yaml
```

_Note, this will generate a yaml-file in the current folder you are in._

Example manifest file:

```powershell
kind: app
resource:
  id: nodejs-web
spec:
  type: nodejs-web
  version: 1.0.0
  # plan: Insert plan-id. Get available plans with command 'litium-cloud marketplace show --app enter-app-id'
  # properties:
  #   - name: artifact
  #     value: artifacts/12345678901234567890123456789012
```

## **Manifest configuration**

**Id**: Choose your own unique-per-environment id of the app. Suggested "nodejs-web"

### Artifact

To deploy your code you need to first [create a node.js artifact](/cloud/serverless/artifacts-create-nodejs-artifact) and refer the artifact id to the property "artifact".

_Note. it is possible to ommit an artifact when installing the app, and instead later use the [deploy command](/cloud/serverless/artifacts-deploy-artifact) to deploy your code artifact to your app._

### SMTP

If your app should send emails, you should configure smtp, read more on the [Install smtp relay app page](/cloud/serverless/public-apps-install-smtp-relay-app)

### App plan

To install a Node.js web private app you need to provide a plan when creating the app. Pricing is based on which plan you select. Run following command to view available plans for Node.js web app:

```powershell
litium-cloud marketplace show --app nodejs-web
```

Insert the plan-id you want after the "plan:" in the manifest file. 

## **Apply** 

Run following command to install the nextjs-web app to environment:

```powershell
litium-cloud apply --subscription enter-subscription-id --environment enter-environment-id -f enter-yaml-filename
```

  
\- Fetch Subscription-id: litium-cloud subscription list  
\- Fetch Environment-id: litium-cloud environment list --subscription enter-subscription-id

_Note! After running the apply command, there will be a prompt with a job-id that you can use to [view status and logs of the job](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/view-status-and-logs)._

This will create a Node.js web app in the given environment. 

## Actions

_For a detailed list about which actions that are available use the following command:_

```powershell
litium-cloud marketplace show --app nodejs-web --details --version add-version-here
```

### Console output

Gets console output from app in container. Normally those logs are sent to Litium insights, but if your app doesn't start issues may be printed to the console but never reach Litium insights because app hasn't started.

See the guide "[Output console logs](/cloud/serverless/output-console-logs)" of how to perform this action.
