1.  [Create release artifact of type "dotnet"](/cloud/serverless/artifacts-create-dotnet-artifact)
2.  In the manifest yaml-file downloaded from the marketplace manifest-command, do the following
    1.  Uncomment "properties"
    2.  Uncomment the property "artifact"
    3.  Add "artifacts/" followed by your artifact-id as "value" for the "artifact" property, e.g. "value: artifacts/d33ae52bb7044adb99d2b4df6fac6216"

_**Note**. It is possible to deploy dotnet-artifacts to the Litium app continiously after the app is installed with the [deploy command](/cloud/serverless/artifacts-deploy-artifact)._
