Serverless Cloud and Litium Insights for Serverless Cloud uses accounts in Litium Account to authenticate and login. Note - this is not the same as the docs-account, so if you haven't logged into Serverless Cloud or Litium Insights for subscriptions in Serverless Cloud before you most likely don't have an account and need to create one.  
  
Having a Litium Account is needed to be able to login to Serverless Cloud CLI and to view logs and BI data for Litium Insights for subscriptions in Serverless Cloud. 

## Permissions

**Important** - to be able to view subscriptions and/or login and view logs and BI-data in Litium Insights you also need the correct permissions setup. Do this **before** you create your account do avoid error messages like unauthorized.

**Subscriptions** \- When a subscription is created Litium Support will give access to the subscription. Then the partner will themselves manage access to additional users. [Read more about access to subscriptions](/cloud/serverless/access).

**Litium Insights** - To give a user permission to Litium insights (logs and/or BI-data) [read more about which access that should be assigned](/cloud/serverless/public-apps-litium-insights). **Important** \- access should be added before the user signs up and try to login

## Troubleshooting

- Can't log in to Litium Insights - getting "You do not have permission..." error - this means that your account doesnt have permissions setup for any subscription in Litium Serverless Cloud. Fix by adding access according to specifications for the [Insights app](/cloud/serverless/public-apps-litium-insights) or talk to your partner for them to give you access.
