# .litiumcloudignore in Litium Serverless Cloud

The .litiumcloudignore file is used to control which files and folders are included in the artifact when building and deploying apps to Litium Serverless Cloud using the litium-cloud CLI. It works similarly to .gitignore, but specifically for the artifact packaging process for all artifacts in Serverless Cloud.

## Purpose

By default, the CLI excludes files listed in:

- `.gitignore`
    
- `.npmignore`
    
- `.litiumcloudignore`
    

If the same file is excluded in multiple files, the exclusion still applies — unless you explicitly override it using negation (`!`).

This makes `.litiumcloudignore` essential when you want to **include specific files** (such as `.env.production`) that are otherwise ignored by convention.

## Common Use Cases

- Including `.env.production` for build-time environment variables
    
- Ensuring test files or build artifacts are excluded from the cloud package
    
- Overriding `.gitignore` rules for deployment-specific needs
    

## Example: Allow `.env.production` to Be Included

```powershell
# .litiumcloudignore

# Explicitly include the production environment file
!.env.production
```

This ensures that `.env.production` is packaged into the deployment artifact, even if `.gitignore` or `.npmignore` exclude it.

> ✅ Required when using `dotenv` to load environment variables at build time in a Next.js app.

## Best Practices

- Always **place `.litiumcloudignore` in the root folder** of your project — the same folder you point to when creating the artifact.
    
- Use negation (`!`) to override ignore rules for specific files or folders.
    

## Debugging Tips

If a file you expect to be included is missing from the deployed app:

- Check if it’s being excluded in `.gitignore`, `.npmignore`, or `.litiumcloudignore`.
    
- Use `!<filename>` in `.litiumcloudignore` to explicitly include it.
    
- Validate your artifact with `litium-cloud artifact download` to inspect its contents.
    
- Don't use wildcard in .gitignore for .env as of now, a current bug prevents this - [Files included with _.gitignore_ and _.litiumcloudignore_ are excluded from the final artifact if _.gitignore_ contains a preceeding exclude-filter](https://docs.litium.com/resources/bugs/bug_details?id=72246)
