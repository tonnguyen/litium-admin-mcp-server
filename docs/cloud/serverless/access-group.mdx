Groups are a convenient way to manage users that should have the same access and permissions.

## Create groups and manage members

Groups are created with the command 'group create'. When creating the group you could add members directly, to add multiple members in the same command, add the option --member multiple tiimes. For example:

```powershell
litium-cloud group create --name MyGroup --member user1@users.com --member user2@users.com
```

_Note. when the group is created it will be given an id in an email format. This id is used when you want to [manage permissions with the access-control commands](/cloud/serverless/access-access-control) for the group._

Additonally you can add/remove individual members of you group after the group is created with the 'group member add' and 'group member remove' command. For example to remove a member of your group:

```powershell
litium-cloud group member remove --email 'user1@users.com' --group group-id
```

If you want to see the members that are assigned to the group, use the show command on the group:

```powershell
litium-cloud group show --group group-id
```
