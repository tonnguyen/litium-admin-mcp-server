Media files and folders can be uploaded through the CLI as an storage artifact to be used together with installation of Litium platform app.

**Prerequirements**

- [Access to the subscription you want to make the artifact available for](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)
- [CLI installed](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)

## Upload artifact

The upload of artifact command is:

```powershell
litium-cloud artifact create --name "My storage - $(get-date)" --file-path your-path --artifact-type storage
```

_Note. the "--file-path" should point to the folder where you have the "media"-folder. For instance "/files/"_

## Retention Policy

Artifacts are automatically deleted based on the following conditions:

1.  **Newly Created Artifacts**: If an artifact was created 14 days ago and has not been used since creation, it will be automatically deleted.
    
2.  **Unused Artifacts**: If an artifact has not been used for 7 days, it will be automatically deleted.
    

#### Example 1:

Artifact 1 is created and actively used in an application. After 30 days, Artifact 2 is created and replaces Artifact 1. Seven days after Artifact 2 replaces Artifact 1, Artifact 1 is automatically deleted.

#### Example 2:

Artifact 1 is created but is never used by any application. After 14 days, Artifact 1 is deleted since it was never used.

## Next step

Once the artifact is uploaded the next step is to reference the artifact-id in the yaml-file of the Litium app that should use it, see [install litium platform](/cloud/serverless/install-litium-platform)
