Access control and groups makes it convenient to give correct permissions to users and groups, and to group users with same access.

## [Access control](/cloud/serverless/access-access-control)

With access control you can control who should have access to a specific resource with which type of permission.

## [Group](/cloud/serverless/access-group)

Groups are a convenient way to manage users that should have the same access and permissions.
