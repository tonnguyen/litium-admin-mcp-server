Enhance access speed with a private Redis Cache, connectable to Dotnet Web apps for efficient data retrieval. Costs are App plan-dependent.

## Pricing

Redis cache is priced per hour based on app plan. [Read more about prices](/cloud/serverless/private-apps-pricing)

## Installation

**Prerequirements**

- [CLI installed](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)
- [Access to the subscription where you want to create a new enviornment](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)
- [Environment created](/cloud/serverless/create-environment-new)

**Manifest**

Run following command to download file-storage manifest:

```powershell
litium-cloud marketplace manifest --app redis-cache -f enter-any-name.yaml
```

_Note, this will generate a yaml-file in the current folder you are in._

Example manifest file:

```powershell
kind: app
resource:
  id: redis-cache
spec:
  type: redis-cache
  version: 1.0.0
  plan:
```

**Manifest configuration**

Id: Choose your own unique-per-environment id of the app. Suggested "redis-cache"

To install a Redis Cache private app you need to provide a plan when creating the app. Pricing is based on which plan you select. Run following command to view available plans for Redis Cache app:

```powershell
litium-cloud marketplace show --app redis-cache
```

Insert the plan-id you want after the "plan:" in the manifest file. 

**Apply** 

Run following command to install the redis-cache app to environment:

```powershell
litium-cloud apply --subscription enter-subscription-id --environment enter-environment-id -f enter-yaml-filename
```

  
\- Fetch Subscription-id: litium-cloud subscription list  
\- Fetch Environment-id: litium-cloud environment list --subscription enter-subscription-id

_Note! After running the apply command, there will be a prompt with a job-id that you can use to [view status and logs of the job](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/view-status-and-logs)._

This will create a Redis Cache app in the given environment. 

## Connect with Dotnet Web app or Litium app

To be able to access your private Redis Cache app from a Dotnet web app or your Litium app you should add configuration in your dotnet web or litium manifest file. 

Example configuration to connect a Redis Cache app with id "redis-cache" to your dotnet web app, note in this example the environment variables is named "CustomRedis\_\_Connectionstring" and "CustomRedis\_\_Password", this would replace any value in appsettings.json in the section "CustomRedis->Connectionstring" and "CustomRedis->Password". 

```powershell
configurations:
    - name: CustomRedis__Connectionstring
      valueFrom: 
        appRef:
          name: redis-cache
          key: connectionstring

    - name: CustomRedis__Password
      valueFrom: 
        appRef:
          name: redis-cache
          key: password
```
