description: "Public apps are predefined apps with a specific purpose. Some public apps have no configuration options, and some apps has both configuration options and the possibility to upload artifacts, for instance the public app Litium platform where you upload your own code artifact, as well as storage and database. While many of the public apps are included in your subscription, such as Litium platform and Litium Insights, there may be other apps that you need a specific agreement to be able to install. There may also be other restrictions, for instance how many instances of an app you may install per environment. For public apps you don't specify an app plan, this is managed automatically for you by Litium."
