The Headless Chrome app gives you access to a Chrome browser for automation tasks such as generating PDFs from HTML content, capturing screenshots, running automated UI tests, and more. It exposes a WebSocket URL that can be consumed by other applications—such as the Litium platform or a .NET web app.

## Pricing

Headless Chrome is priced **per hour** based on selected app plan. [Read more about prices](/cloud/serverless/private-apps-pricing)

## Installation

**Prerequisites**

Make sure the following are in place:

- [CLI installed](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)
- [Access to the subscription where you want to create a new environment](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)
- [Environment created](/cloud/serverless/create-environment-new)

### Step 1: Download the Manifest

Use the following command to download the Headless Chrome manifest:

```powershell
litium-cloud marketplace manifest --app headless-chrome -f enter-any-name.yaml
```

  
📄 This will generate a `.yaml` file in your current working directory.

### Step 2: Configure the manifest file

```powershell
kind: app
resource:
  id: headless-chrome
spec:
  type: headless-chrome
  plan: [insert-plan-id]
  version: 1.0.0
```

- **id**: Choose a unique-per-environment ID, suggested: `headless-chrome`
    
- **properties**: Headless Chrome does not require any custom properties
    
- **plan:** insert plan-id based on which plan that best suits your needs
    

### Step 3: Apply the app to an environment 

Run the following command to install the app:

```powershell
litium-cloud apply --subscription enter-subscription-id --environment enter-environment-id -f enter-yaml-filename
```

  
🧠 Helpful commands:

- Get Subscription id
    
    ```powershell
    litium-cloud subscription list
    ```
    
- Get Environment id
    
    ```powershell
    litium-cloud environment list --subscription enter-subscription-id
    ```
    

📌 After running the apply command, there will be a prompt with a **job-id** that you can use to [view status and logs of the job](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/view-status-and-logs).

✅ This will deploy the Headless Chrome app to the specified environment.

## How to use

To connect to your Headless Chrome instance from another app (e.g., Litium platform or a .NET app), use the WebSocket **URL** exposed by the Headless Chrome app. 

**Note** - The exposed URL is internal and can only be accessed by other apps within **Serverless Cloud**. It is not accessible from outside the Serverless Cloud environment.

**Tip** - View properties that an app exposes  
litium-cloud marketplace show --app headless-chrome --version 1.0.0

### Example: Configure another app to use Chrome

To use the Chrome socket in another app, configure it to fetch the URL by setting up configurations:

```powershell
  configurations:
    - name: CHROME__SOCKET
      valueFrom:
        appRef:
          name: headless-chrome
          key: url
```

This will populate the `CHROME__SOCKET` environment variable with the WebSocket URL from the Headless Chrome app.

Add this configuration section to the YAML file of the app that needs to access Headless Chrome—such as the Litium platform app—then re-apply it using "apply" command.

### Example - generate PDF with PuppeteerSharp

Below is a sample C# method using [PuppeteerSharp](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp) to generate a PDF:

```csharp
public async Task<byte[]> GeneratePdf()
{
    string htmlContent = @"<!DOCTYPE html>
                        <html lang=""en"">
                        <head>
                        </head>
                        <body>
                            <h1>Test PDF</h1>
                            <p>This is a test PDF document generated using PuppeteerSharp.</p>
                        </body>
                        </html>
                        ";


    var browserWSEndpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("CHROME__SOCKET");

    var connectOptions = new ConnectOptions
    {
        BrowserWSEndpoint = browserWSEndpoint,
        DefaultViewport = null
    };

    var browser = await Puppeteer.ConnectAsync(connectOptions);

    using (var page = await browser.NewPageAsync())
    {
        // Set content of the page
        await page.SetContentAsync(htmlContent);

        // Generate PDF
        return await page.PdfDataAsync(new PdfOptions
        {
            Format = PaperFormat.A4,
            PrintBackground = true,
            MarginOptions = new MarginOptions
            {
                Top = "20mm",
                Bottom = "20mm",
                Left = "15mm",
                Right = "15mm"
            }
        });
    }
}
```
