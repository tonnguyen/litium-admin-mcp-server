# Litium storefront

Litium Storefront is a React-based, headless app that serves as the frontend for your site if you're using a headless architecture.

## Install

Maximum one Litium storefront app may be installed per environment. Read more about how to install Litium storefront app in the [getting started section](/cloud/serverless/install-nextjs-storefront-app). 

Read more about the [React accelerator](/accelerators/react-accelerator).

## Deployments

See [deploy artifact page](/cloud/serverless/guides/artifacts/deploy-artifact) for how to deploy a new version.

Deployments to **production environments** are performed on a rolling scenario, meaning when you deploy the release artifacts the cloud automatically deploys the code to one replica at the time and letting users access the new version without downtime.

See the [automated deployments guide](/cloud/serverless/guides/automated-deployments) on examples how to automate deployments with the help of the CLI.

```

### Console output

## Logs
