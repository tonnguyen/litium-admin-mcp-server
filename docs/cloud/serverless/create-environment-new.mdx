**Prerequirements**

- [CLI installed](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)
- [Access to the subscription where you want to create a new enviornment](https://docs.litium.com/platform/get-started/developer-tools/litium-cloud-cli/getting-started-with-cloud-cli)

**Create an enviornment**

To create an environment, run following command:

```powershell
litium-cloud environment create --name enter-name --subscription enter-subscription --location enter-location-id
```

Fetch location-id: `litium-cloud location list`  
Fetch subscription-id: `litium-cloud subscription list`

Tips for environment name could be prod/test/qa/demo/staging etc.

## Production environment

For production environments you should include flag "--production" when creating the environment. This will mark the environment as production environment and make sure the correct production resources are applied to your production Litium apps. 

**Important** All non-production environments and system domain _litium.app_ will automatically get robots directives set to noindex and nofollow. 

It is also possible to set production flag after the environment is created, this is done with the 'litium-cloud environment update --production' command. **Important** if litium app and storefront apps are already installed when setting the production flag, the apps needs to be restarted or redeployed for the changes to take effect.

To unset an environment as production you use the 'litium-cloud environment update --non-production' command
