To optimize performance in production environments, Litium background jobs now run automatically on a dedicated Worker Node. This setup reduces the load on public nodes that serves web requests, enhancing the user experience.

This feature is included at **no extra cost** in Litium Serverless Cloud, and is activated by default in environments marked as Production. _Note that this does not replace the benefits of [private apps](/cloud/serverless/private-apps) to integrate your custom workload such as integrations._

## Requirements

- Environment is marked as production
- Litium version is 8.16.0 or higher

## What is a background job?

Following workloads will be executed automatically on the worker node:

- Scheduled jobs that has demand set as "worker" or execution restriction set as DisallowConcurrentDistributedExecution. [Read more about job scheduler](/platform/get-started/concepts).
- [ERP connect API](/apis/connect/overview)
- Backoffice background tasks - such as Excel export/import.
