- [Environment created](/cloud/serverless/create-environment-new)

```

_Note, this will generate a yaml-file in the current folder you are in._

**Login to Litium Insight**

Browse to [Insights](https://insights.litium.cloud/login?next=%2F) and choose to login with "Litium Account (serverless)", use same account as you use for Litium Serverless Cloud. Application logs and other metrics for your environment is present after logged in.

**Add access to other users**

For a user to have access to Insight for a particular environment they need to be [granted access control](/cloud/serverless/access-access-control) to the Insights application. To get access to Ingishts a user needs to have at least the role "system/reader" to the subscription and at least the role "system/contributor" to the Insights app.

Best practice is to [add a group](/cloud/serverless/access-group), e.g. "Insights users". And give that group [access](/cloud/serverless/access-access-control) to the subscription with the role "system/reader" and access to the insights app with the role "system/contributor". Then add all members that should have access to that group.
