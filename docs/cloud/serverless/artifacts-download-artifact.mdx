# Download artifact

It is possible to download the artifacts you have access to onto your local computer.

To download an artifact you use the command 'artifact download' with options '--artifact' pointing to the id of the artifact and the option '--file' where you enter the path and filename where you want the results to be downloaded to. 

Different type of artifacts is downloaded with different file format:

- dotnet - .zip file
- storage - .zip file
- sqlbackup - .bak file
- nextjs - .zip file

Example command

```powershell
litium-cloud artifact download --artifact 12345678910 --file mydatabase.bak
```

## Get artifact id

To get all available artifacts for a subscription, use the "artifact list"-command. To get information about which specific artifacts an app is currently using, use the "app show" command.

_**Note** that artifacts have retention policies, read about retention policies for [code artifacts](/cloud/serverless/artifacts), [database artifacts](/cloud/serverless/artifacts-create-sql-backup-artifact) and [storage artifacts](/cloud/serverless/artifacts-create-storage-backup-artifact)._
