## Prefill customer details

Briqpay offers the capability on how to prefill already logged in users. All data is forwarded to the app using predefined keys in the AdditionalInfo property of the CheckoutFlowInfo.

```csharp
Dictionary additionalData = new Dictionary(); // IF Your customer is logged in, you can send in the CIN to tbe briqpay iframe
additionalData.Add("CompanyIdentificationNumber", "6666666666");
```

If you have internal addresses on the customer that you wish for them to be able to select inside of the checkout iframe, you can forward those to briqpay

```csharp
List prefillAddressList = new List();
var addressFromErp = new MerchantPrefillAddress();
addressFromErp.Cellno = "087643533";
addressFromErp.City = "Erp City";
addressFromErp.Streetaddress = "SreetName";
addressFromErp.Email = "mymail@erp.com";
prefillAddressList.Add(addressFromErp);
additionalData.Add("CustomerPossibleBillingAddressList", JsonConvert.SerializeObject(prefillAddressList));
```

Prefill custom shipping address:

```csharp
var address2FromErp = new MerchantPrefillAddress();
address2FromErp.Cellno = "087643533";
address2FromErp.City = "Erp City";
address2FromErp.Streetaddress = "SreetName shpping";
address2FromErp.Email = "mymail@erp.com";
address2FromErp.Streetaddress2 = " my other street";
address2FromErp.Zip = "34533";
prefillAddressList.Add(address2FromErp);
additionalData.Add("CustomerPossibleShippingAddressList", JsonConvert.SerializeObject(prefillAddressList));
```

By default shipping addresses are locked from user edits, but can be enabled on request by the following setting:

```csharp
additionalData.Add("CustomerIsAllowedEditShippingAddress", "true");
```

Add to CheckoutFlowinfo:

```csharp
return new CheckoutFlowInfo 
    {
    AllowSeparateShippingAddress = true, 
    CustomerType = ToCustomerType((CheckoutMode)checkoutModeInt), 
    CheckoutPageUrl = checkoutPageUrl, 
    TermsUrl = GetAbsolutePageUrl(checkoutPage?.EntitySystemId.MapTo().GetValue(CheckoutPageFieldNameConstants.TermsAndConditionsPage)), 
    ReceiptPageUrl = GetAbsolutePageUrl(websiteModel.GetValue(AcceleratorWebsiteFieldNameConstants.OrderConfirmationPage)), 
    CancelPageUrl = checkoutPageUrl, 
    AdditionalInfo = additionalData // Make sure to add the additional data to the checkoutflow 
    };
```
