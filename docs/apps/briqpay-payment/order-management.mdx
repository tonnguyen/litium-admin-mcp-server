# Order management

*   Litium 8

The Briqpay Litium app is designed to manage all aspects of order processing, including captures and refunds, in accordance with actions performed within the Litium platform.

### Captures

Captures are initiated when a shipment is created in Litium. This action generates a pending capture status within Litium. Upon receiving a callback from the Payment Service Provider (PSP) confirming the capture approval, the capture status will be updated accordingly in Litium.

### Refunds

Refunds to PSPs are triggered when a refund action is executed on a sales return order. Similar to the capture process, a pending refund status is recorded initially and is subsequently updated only after Briqpay receives notification from the PSP confirming the refund.

These order management actions are standard within the Litium Accelerator; however, system integrators have the flexibility to modify or relocate these triggers as needed. The events governing these processes are as follows:

*   `Litium.Connect.Payments.Events.CaptureTransaction`
*   `Litium.Connect.Payments.Events.RefundTransaction`

The Briqpay app subscribes to these events during the installation process, ensuring proper integration and responsiveness to order management activities.

## Reading PSP ID for reconciliation process.

The Briqpay app saves the capture ID to transactions to assist with the reconciliation process. When a capture occurs, the Briqpay API returns a `capture.reservationId` from the PSP which is saved as `TransactionReference2` on the `Sales.Transaction` object in Litium. This can be forward to your ERP in order to match transactions from PSP
