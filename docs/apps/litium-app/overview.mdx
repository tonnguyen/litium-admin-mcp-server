This article describes how Litium apps are installed, configured, and uninstalled in the Litium Backoffice. Please note that you first need to setup each app in your environment before it can be installed.

## Litium app installation flow

![litium-app-installation.png](https://docs.litium.com/storage/ma/02df75a0bee6403394b7fb4988a89e4c/1479f1b0f0a346adbb8aa400c5833f3d/png/95355525C9D95944563D96807503C4D129643F73/litium-app-installation.png)

**Note!** To install an app, a back-office account with settings permissions has to be used.

The back-office user can access any page of the app. (1)

If the app is not installed, it will build an installation URL and then redirect to the installation URL. (1.1)

The browser accesses URL for installation. (2)

If the app is added, it will redirect to the details page (2.1) and if not, Litium will send a request to the Litium app to get metadata, and then use it to create the app. (2.2)

**Note!** Once the app has been installed in a Litium instance, the app URL will no longer work. The app needs to be uninstalled before the app URL can be used to install the app in another Litium instance.

The back-office user clicks the **Install button** on the details page. (1)

Litium creates a new service account for the app. (1.1).

On the details page, the user clicks the **Uninstall** button. (1)

Litium sends a request with null service account to the app. (1.1)

If the request is unsuccessful, the system will then throw an exception. (1.2)

Litium deletes the service account of the app (1.3) and removes the installation's info of the app. (1.4) 

On the list page, the user selects app and then clicks Delete the button. (2)

If step (1) is unsuccessful, the data of the app cannot be deleted. In this case, the user can force to delete the app by selecting the force delete checkbox in popup.

if user selects force delete checkbox, Litium deletes the service account of the App (2.1) and removes the installation's info of the app. (2.2) 

Litium deletes the data of the app from the database. (2.3)
