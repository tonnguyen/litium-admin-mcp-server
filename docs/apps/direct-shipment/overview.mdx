# Direct Shipment

*   Litium 8

Direct Shipment is a pseudo delivery provider, developed in Litium for testing and direct shipment handling tasks.

Direct Shipment can be used for:

1.  Simulating a delivery provider, without having to configure a real one! This could be useful, until you get your accounts configured from a real delivery provider.
2.  Allowing the placement of e-commerce orders and handle shipments manually.
3.  Testing a delivery checkout widget on the checkout page.
4.  Custom implementation, for example, to place the purchase order into your ERP system.
