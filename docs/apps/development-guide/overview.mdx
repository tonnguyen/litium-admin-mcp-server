# Litium app development guide

*   Litium 8

This development guide aims to explain how an Litium app can be built. The guide is based on development using .NET.

### [App concept](/add-ons/get-started/app-development-guide/app-concept)

A Litium app allows you to extend the functionality of the Litium platform. A typical use-case for an app is to integrate a Litium solution with a third-party system that provide a specialized service within the e-commerce ecosystem, like payment service providers, transport management systems or the company’s ERP system.

### [Development environment](/add-ons/get-started/app-development-guide/development-environment)

To be able to develop a Litium app you need a number of things in your development environment.

### [App installation](/add-ons/get-started/app-development-guide/app-installation)

A Litium app needs to register with the Litium instance that it will be connected to. The app will then be available on the apps page in Settings in Litium backoffice. On the apps page the user can install and uninstall apps and upload configuration files to installed apps.

### [Using the app management package](/add-ons/get-started/app-development-guide/using-the-app-management-package)

Litium provides a pre-built package that handles the app management API functions that is required to install, configure and uninstall an app.

### [Deployment in LCC](/add-ons/get-started/app-development-guide/deployment)

When you have finished developing and testing your app in your development environment, you need to deploy it to Litium Commerce Cloud (LCC) to make it available to others. LCC currently only supports apps built on .NET.
