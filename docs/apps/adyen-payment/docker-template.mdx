# Docker template for local installation

*   Litium 8

Values to replace in the template:

*   ports
*   environment
    *   ASPNETCORE\_HTTPS\_PORT
    *   AppMetadata\_\_AppUrl
    *   LitiumApi\_\_ApiUrl
    *   AppConfiguration\_\_DisableCallbacks: If you are developing and are behind a firewall, you may need to disable background calls from external systems. The reason is that the external system cannot reach the addon app in your local environment and the app will not work as expected.
