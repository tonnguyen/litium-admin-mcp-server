# Direct payment

*   Litium 8

Direct payment app is a pseudo payment provider, developed by Litium for testing and direct cash handling tasks.

Direct Payment can be used for:

1.  Simulating a payment provider, without having to configure a real one. This could be useful until you get your accounts configured from a real payment provider.
2.  Allowing the e-commerce administrators to place orders and collect money manually.
3.  Custom implementation, eg to place the a sales order into your ERP system which would handle the invoicing.

## Version dependencies

*   Direct payment app 1.3.0
    
    *   Supports Connect Payments API 1.0
        
    *   Requires Litium 8.6 or later.
