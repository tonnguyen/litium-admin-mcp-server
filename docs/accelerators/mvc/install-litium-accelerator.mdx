# Install Litium accelerator

- Litium 8

Installation instructions for Litium accelerator.

Follow the steps below to install the latest version of the Accelerator. Please see the release notes for the [latest version here](/accelerators/mvc/release-notes).

### Before you start

Before Litium Accelerator is installed you need to set up the [Litium NuGet feed](/platform/get-started/litium-packages).

Also, set up Elasticsearch, Redis, and Kibana. Please see the [setup instructions here](/platform/get-started/shared-dependencies).

Use a [version control system](/accelerators/mvc/upgrade-and-maintenance) for easy upgrades of Litium Accelerator.

### Install the template package

The Accelerator template package is a pre-created package.

Installation of the template package is only needed the first time the version is created.

Only one version of the template package can exist at the same time.

1. Open Powershell command prompt
2. Install the template pack with

   ```powershell
   dotnet new install "Litium.Accelerator.Templates"
   ```

   After the template is installed, a list of available templates is shown  
   ![Template list](/images/accelerators/mvc/Screenshot_14.png)  
   _Note: To update the template to a later version, you should run the installation command again._

   If you want to install a specific version of the template you need to append the version number to the template name separated by two colons (::) example for template for the 8.0.0 version

   ```powershell
   dotnet new install "Litium.Accelerator.Templates::8.0.0"
   ```

## Install and run Litium Accelerator

1. Open the Powershell command prompt in the folder where the Accelerator should be installed.
2. Install the Litium Accelerator with the following ​command.

   ```powershell
   dotnet new litmvcacc
   ```

   To include the Storefront API in the accelerator installation you need to add the `--storefront-api` to the command.

   ```powershell
   dotnet new litmvcacc --storefront-api
   ```

   During the creation of Litium Accelerator, the restore of projects and installation of `litium-db` tool are performed.

   [If the installation is performed without errors, continue to step 3](#install-and-run-litium-accelerator).

   Manually restore the project's dependencies

   ```powershell
   dotnet tool restore
   dotnet restore
   ```

   Manually install `litium-db` tool

   ```powershell
   dotnet new tool-manifest
   dotnet tool install Litium.Application.Migrations
   ```

   Please find more information about database management and [how to install specific versions of the db-tool here](/platform/get-started/developer-tools-db-tool).

3. Setup the database with help of the `litium-db` tool. Using the command (**Note!** An empty database must exist before the command can run)

   ```powershell
   dotnet litium-db update --connection "Pooling=true;User Id=user;Password=secret;Database=litium8;Server=127.0.0.1;TrustServerCertificate=True"
   ```

   _Remember to replace the settings in the connectionstring for your database._

4. Config your Litium Accelerator installation.

   See [.Net configuration](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/), where you should put common non secret settings for the project (`appSettings.json`, `appSettings.Development.json`, and `appSettings.Production.json`),  [user-secrets should be used for development configuration and local secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=windows).

### Optional: Build the client project (only if you are modifying client resource files)

The Litium Accelerator comes with pre-built client resource files, so you do not have to build them yourself.

However, if you have modified client resources under any project, then you need to build the project. Here is how to do it:

1. Make sure that you have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) installed and in the path.
2. Execute `BuildClientProjects.bat` file.

Note:

- If you are building `Litium.Accelerator.FieldTypes`, the output folder is `Litium.Accelerator.FieldTypes\dist`. Build the `Litium.Accelerator.FieldTypes.csproj` after building client resources to embed the script in the assembly.
- If you are building `Litium.Accelerator.Mvc`, the output folder is `Litium.Accelerator.Mvc\UI`. If you update only `js`, `scss` or `cshtml` files, then you do not need to build `Litium.Accelerator.Mvc.csproj`. Note that you still need to build client resources when you update `js` files.
- If you are building `Litium.Accelerator.Email`, the output folder is `Litium.Accelerator.Email\dist`. By default, `ConfirmationEmail.html` is copied to `Litium.Accelerator.Mvc\Views\Email` and renamed with `.cshtml` as extension. In case you want to automatically copy more files when building the project, modify `gulpfile.babel.js` file to add more files to be copied in the copy function.

## Create your accelerator website

1. In Visual Studio, go to **Solution Explorer** and select the `Litium.Accelerator.Mvc` project. Context-click and select **Set as StartUp project.**
2. Start the accelerator with the **Start without debugging** option in the **Debug** menu. This will open a web browser with the port number. Type "litium" after the port number to display the login page for the Litium back office.
3. Log in as a user with System All permissions. Please read more about [how to log in here](/platform/get-started/create-admin-user-and-log-in).  
   _Example `https://localhost:5001/litium`_
4. Open the settings by clicking the cogwheel in the upper right corner. In the left panel, expand the node **Deployment** where you will find the accelerator.  
   ![Deployment menu](/images/accelerators/mvc/SettingMenu.png)
5. Click on the accelerator to install.
6. Enter a name and a domain name for the Accelerator website.  
   ![Deploy accelerator](/images/accelerators/mvc/DeployAccelerator.JPG)
7. Click the **Import** button and wait for a message confirming that the installation was successful. Note that an active internet connection is needed to download the installation package.

   Your accelerator website has now been created.

   This means that the following items are also created:

   - A folder in **Media** for the Accelerator media files.
   - An assortment for the Accelerator categories and products.
   - A price list.
   - An inventory.
   - The default B2B buyer roles _Order approver_ and _Buyer._

## Secure connection (SSL)

Every page should use a secure connection. By setting the HSTS (Http Strict Transport Security) for the domain name, we force the website to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. To configure HSTS, navigate to **Settings** > **Globalization** > **Domain names**, select a domain name, click **Edit** and then choose to edit **HSTS max age** to a value greater than 0.

[From Qualys](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2016/03/28/the-importance-of-a-proper-http-strict-transport-security-implementation-on-your-web-server) it is advisable to assign the max-age directive’s value to be greater than 10368000 seconds (120 days) and ideally to 31536000 (one year). Websites should aim to ramp up the max-age value to ensure heightened security for a long duration for the current domain and/or subdomains.
