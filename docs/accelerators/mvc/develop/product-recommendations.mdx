# Product recommendations

*   Litium 8

Litium uses Litium Search to provide product recommendations to customers.

When a customer has purchased a product, this product will be added to an index that contains all the users  
with all the products they have purchased if their orders have been confirmed.  
   
The search engine analyzes purchase data to get recommended products for a product that is shown on the page. A list of most sold products is returned via the .NET API. 

The calculations are refreshed every 24 hours. 

Orders older than 6 months are excluded from the calculation. 

### Product recommendation types

This generates two types of product recommendations:

*   "Most bought" products, which are the products that have the highest number of purchases overall. 
*   "Most bought together with", which are product recommendations based on what other customers have bought together with the same purchased product.
