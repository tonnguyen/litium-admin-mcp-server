# Web content accessibility guidelines

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), provide a shared international standard for web accessibility. The React Accelerator is designed to be compliant with the WCAG 2.2 Level AA standard.

To better comply with the EU Accessibility Act the Litium Accelerator supports most of the necessary changes to comply with [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/). Below are some things added to enhance accessibility.

- Enhanced ARIA attributes for core elements, including navigation, sidebars, modals, dropdowns, checkboxes, accordions, images, and icons.
- Keyboard navigation support is implemented for all complex and interactive components.
- Improved form accessibility using autocomplete and dedicated ARIA attributes for better input handling.
- Utilized Landmarks to clearly define page regions for screen reader navigation.
- Implemented skip links to allow users to bypass menus and jump directly to main content.
- Utilized semantically appropriate `<Button>` elements across various components for improved accessibility.
- Implemented a color scheme that ensures enhanced contrast for improved readability.
- Focus styles are clearly defined and visible to aid keyboard users.
- Ensured consistent component usage throughout the application for a reliable user experience.
- Integrated the jsx-a11y ESLint plugin for static accessibility checks in the codebase.

## Best practices

To ensure your solution complies with WCAG 2.2 AA, here are our recommendations:

- Use built-in components of the React Accelerator.
- For custom page templates and components, use these tools to check for compliance:
  - ESLint: for static code analysis.
