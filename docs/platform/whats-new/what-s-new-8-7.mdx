## Litium Connect ERP API

### Ability for system to manage returns coming from Connect ERP API

To help merchants and simplify the refund of money Litium need to be able to receive information about the returned products and orders, calculate the amount to refund and to execute the refund of the payment.

With this functionality implemented the system will get ability to receive a return slip, create a Return Merchandize Authorization (RMA), get an ApproveRMA through the Litium Connect ERP API, to process the RMA, to create a Sales Return Order based on the RMA, to calculate the amount to be refunded, execute the refund of the payment and to complete the return.

## Litium PIM

### Ability for system to syndicate products

The purpose is to allow merchants to automatically distribute product information to external systems in formats that suit the receiving system. The typical use case is the transfer of product data to an external marketplace like Zalando or Amazon, who has their own set of fields and formats required. The syndication is set up programmatically, and there is not a UI yet to change the configuration.

## Litium Accelerator

Also the labels for Search, My pages/login and Checkout were hidden to align with modern standards.
