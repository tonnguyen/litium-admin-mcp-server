Ability to migrate to Litium 8 from previous versions (beta)
From now on, all existing customers have the ability to upgrade to Litium 8 using an upgrade script to transform the data model from earlier versions to the new data model of Litium 8. The upgrade script is released as a beta. This means testing and documentation is complete, but since there can be non-standard modifications in customer databases we encourage partners to feedback any findings as bug reports. This way, we can cover more edge scenarios before making the ability generally available. It is not a closed beta, so any partner can use the ability in any project.
Ability to follow up sales on discounts and campaigns
Adminstrators can now follow the sales KPIs Total sales, Number of orders and Average order value for discounts and campaigns in back office.

Improvements in Connect Payments API
Litium now supports shipping option selection inside payments widgets. A confirmation widget from the payment provider can be displayed on the order confirmation page. Properties to set allowed customer types (person, organisation or both) and whether to allow a separate shipping address is added to the checkout flow.
