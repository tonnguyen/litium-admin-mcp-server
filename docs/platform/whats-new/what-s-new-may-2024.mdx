# Litium

## Ability to give free delivery for selected delivery methods

With this ability it is possible for merchants to give free delivery only for selected delivery methods.

## Ability to use a marketing discount

In some cases there is a need to use the Litium campaigns without offering any discount. One scenario is when a merchant does not use discounts for marketing, for example in B2B, but still finds it useful to follow up sales of a particular set of products. Another situation is when you need all the settings for a discount, like product selection, target groups and other conditions, but you want to add your own custom action for a buyer when the discount is valid. It can be adding extra bonus points to a loyalty system or any other custom action.

## Redis connection improvement for stability

With this ability the Litium platform reuses the connection for the Redis server communication.

## Performance improvement in price and discount calculator

The purpose is to improve performance and avoid unnecessary lookups for the list price when a discounted price is calculated. With this new ability, the price list lookup is reused between the list price and the discount price calculations.

## Performance improvement in URL generation

With this improvement the system generates URLs for base products that contains hundreds of variants in a more efficient way.

# React accelerator

The React accelerator is only available to customers running Litium Commerce Cloud and note that you can run it locally and in Litium serverless cloud.

The headless React accelerator is built on React and Next.JS and has all the tools and frameworks you would expect from a modern single page application. It is designed mobile first for a better and updated user experience.

The new react accelerator has its own description and release notes, but here are some of the new things delivered in this release.

## Ability for global block preview

With this ability, a backoffice user is able to preview React accelerator blocks in the Litium backoffice. To be able to preview global blocks, the React Accelerator need the ability to fetch and render the block.
