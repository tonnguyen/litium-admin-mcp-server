We are excited to introduce the new October Litium release, packed with great abilities such as new order editing features, management of lowest last 30 days price and WCAG compliancy for the React accelerator.

We are excited to introduce the new October Litium release, packed with great abilities such as new order editing features, management of lowest last 30 days price and WCAG compliancy for the React accelerator.
To deliver value to the market more quickly and support the success of both our customers and partners, we will begin releasing Litium minor versions on a monthly basis.
 
As an administrator working with editing confirmed orders, there are often a need to add a discount to an existing order row. With this feature we add this ability to the edit order page in Litium backoffice.

 
When working with orders that are having issues with capture or refund of payments it is a common need to retry a previous transaction to see if the issue has been resolved at the payment provider. With this feature we add the ability to retry failed and refused payments from a payment detail view in backoffice.

 
The Litium Accelerator now better supports compliance with the EU Accessibility Act by meeting most requirements for WCAG 2.2 AA. This enhancement ensures that all pages and components in the React Accelerator now have improved coverage for the WCAG 2.2 AA level.
