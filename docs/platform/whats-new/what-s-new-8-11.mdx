## React accelerator (beta 4)

The new react accelerator has its own description and release notes, but here are some of the new things delivered this time.

The React accelerator is designed mobile first for a better and updated user experience.

## Checkout page (React accelerator)

The checkout is completely redesigned in the React accelerator. It meets modern user expectations by an elaborate design for both mobile and larger screens, exposing the user to only relevant information to minimize the cognitive load. Also the design of form elements are changed to include hint texts inside textboxes that are minimized when the user starts typing.

The checkout page is designed to support some combinations of payment methods. For example, if multiple iframe checkouts are configured for a channel, only the first one will be used in the checkout and an iframe checkout cannot be combined with an inline or a payment checkout. The system will render the iframe checkout and ignore the inline and payment checkout. However, an inline or a payment checkout can be combined.
