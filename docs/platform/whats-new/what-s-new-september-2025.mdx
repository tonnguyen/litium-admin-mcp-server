# What's new September 2025

We are excited to introduce the new September Litium release, packed with great enhancements to improve working with orders, bulk editing product fields directly in the UI and continuing to improve the admin UI for how to work with search results and lists in general.

# Product fields bulk editing

As an administrator working with products you can edit multiple products using the export and import to Excel. However, the handling of a file can cause unexpected errors, that can be difficult to solve. With this new feature, it is possible to edit product fields directly in the UI, allowing faster and more controlled bulk product editing.

How to use it

# Improved order management

We have made several improvements to the order list in backoffice. You can now filter orders by article number to quickly find all orders containing a specific product. Sorting by order date is now supported in both ascending and descending order, giving you more control over the list view. Finally, the order list can now display which tags are applied to each order, and you can also view tags applied to shipments or payments, making order management clearer and more transparent.

# Improved lists and search result management

We’ve made a series of updates to help you work more efficiently with less effort. In the products search result, buttons have been rearranged into clear menus — one per row and one above the list — so actions are always easy to find. To further reduce cognitive load, we’ve removed the alternating gray/white lines and updated the color scheme. Administrators can now also save searches for Organizations as reusable views. This makes it faster to repeat recurring tasks and enables teams to share and collaborate on the exact same filtered views.
