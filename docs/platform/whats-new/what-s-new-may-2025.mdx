# New Litium dashboards & reports

We are excited to introduce the new sales dashboards & reports in Litium, designed to completely change how you track and analyze your sales data. In today's competitive digital commerce landscape, the ability to track sales through data insights is crucial for any online merchant. This powerful new tool empowers you to understand your performance, identify trends, and make informed choices that can lead to increased sales and improved customer satisfaction. By leveraging data insights, digital commerce businesses can optimize their operations, enhance marketing strategies, and ultimately drive growth.

Plese note: The new dashboard is available to customers running Litium Commerce Cloud (LCC) and that have migrated to Litium serverless cloud.

Please note: The old dashboard and widgets is still available for all customers.

## Why track your business performance?

Tracking your sales through data insights provides you with a clear and comprehensive view of your business's performance. For example, you can use data to monitor total sales, the number of orders, average order value, and return rates. This information helps you understand which markets are performing well, which marketing campaigns are effective, and where there might be opportunities for improvement. By analyzing this data, you can make strategic decisions to enhance your offerings, adjust pricing strategies, and improve customer service.

Imagine noticing a sudden increase in return rates. By analyzing the data, you can identify the root cause of the issue, such as a defect in a batch of products or misleading product descriptions. With this information, you can take corrective actions, such as improving product quality or updating the product descriptions, to reduce return rates and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Real-time sales tracking with Litium reports

Now, with the new dashboard in Litium, you can track your sales in real-time. This powerful tool allows you to create custom reports for total sales, the number of orders, average order value, and return rates. You can slice the data by different date periods, and group and filter it by date frequency, market, channel, campaign, currency, and more. This flexibility enables you to gain deeper insights into your sales performance and make data-driven decisions.

The real-time tracking feature ensures that you are always up-to-date with the latest sales data. This immediacy allows you to respond quickly to emerging trends and make timely adjustments to your strategies. Whether you are monitoring a specific campaign's performance or analyzing overall market trends, the Litium dashboard provides the tools you need to stay ahead.

## Customizable and visual data presentation

The dashboard offers various graphical presentation options, including column tables, pie charts, and numbers, allowing you to visualize the data in a way that best suits your needs. You can compare data with the previous period or the previous year, and choose to display data including or excluding VAT. This comparative analysis helps you understand trends and measure the impact of your strategies over time.

Moreover, the ability to create multiple dashboards for different purposes adds another layer of customization. For each dashboard, you can select the reports you want to display and easily move and arrange them using drag-and-drop functionality. This ensures that you have the most relevant information at your fingertips, tailored to your specific needs.

Additionally, the dashboard's user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate and customize your reports. This proactive approach helps you stay on top of your business performance and make informed decisions that drive growth.

The visual presentation options are designed to make data interpretation straightforward and intuitive. Whether you prefer detailed tables or visual charts, the Litium dashboard accommodates your preferences. This versatility allows you to present data in a way that is most meaningful to you and your team, facilitating better communication and collaboration.

## In summary

In conclusion, tracking sales through data insights is essential for digital commerce businesses to stay competitive and drive growth. The new dashboard in Litium provides a powerful and flexible tool to monitor sales in real-time, create custom reports, and visualize data in various formats. By leveraging these insights, you can make informed decisions, optimize your operations, and ultimately achieve greater success.

## Ability to overwrite all when uploading files

As an administrator, when uploading a file that already exists in a folder in Media you get the option to "Overwrite" or "Cancel". If you want to replace a lot of files you will get the question for each file, which is very time consuming.

With this improvement, you can click Overwrite all or Cancel all.

## Improved performance of product search by article number

As an administrator working with search and filter when having hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of orders, the response times can be slower than expected.

With this improvement, the article number search and the name search have been separated, which will lower the response times for users when searching products by article number.

# Storefront API

## Improved performance searching and filtering products on public site

When browsing a public site with extensive product listings—often numbering in the hundreds of thousands or even millions—response times can sometimes be slower than expected.

This improvement ensures that product searches and filtering on the public site will query a search index that has been rebuilt with a new structure for how information is stored, significantly reducing response times and enhancing the user experience.
