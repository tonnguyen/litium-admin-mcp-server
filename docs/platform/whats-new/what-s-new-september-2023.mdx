## Top navigation, notifications and account

The redesigned top navigation offers improved clarity about your location. It still provides quick access to the areas Dashboard, Sales, Products, Websites, Customers and Media. Plus, you'll notice larger icons for product workflows and account access, with Settings and Help conveniently relocated to the left navigation.

## Left navigation

Our left navigation also got a makeover for a smoother user experience. Enjoy improved contrasts and larger fonts for easy navigation. Also, we’ve updated green action buttons to links with a plus icon and placed Settings and Help at the bottom for your convenience.

## Ability to use a trashcan for media

Now, you can safeguard your media with the Media trashcan. It prevents accidental deletions, giving you the option to restore or permanently delete items as needed.

## Ability for administrator to set customer number for organization and person

## Removal of display templates for products and categories

To make it simpler to configure products and categories, and homogenize the data modeling in Litium, we have moved all settings from the display template to the field template for products and categories. The display template has been deprecated, and the configuration of MVC controllers for each website has been removed.

## Ability to define file extensions in app settings

We've added a possibility to add your own project specific file extensions in the app settings file.

## React accelerator, release candidate 1

We are happy to announce the first release candidate of the React accelerator. Release candidate is the first stage with official support and when we recommend partners to start using it in projects. Features are not ported 1:1 from the MVC accelerator, so please update yourself on the details by reading the docs and checking whether the features you need are built or still planned.

Read more about features being built or still planned

The React accelerator is only accessible to customers running on Litium Commerce Cloud and please note that you can run it locally and in your own development environments. Support for running it in Litium serverless cloud will come later this October.

The headless React accelerator is built on React and Next.JS and has all the tools and frameworks you would expect from a modern single page application. It is designed mobile first for a better and updated user experience.

The new react accelerator has its own description and release notes, but here are some of the new things delivered this time.

## Ability to filter products (React accelerator)

The product filters of the React accelerator has a completely new mobile first design, for optimized user experience. Filters can be added and cleared easily, and filter sections can be collapsed to avoid cognitive load.

## Ability to define secondary links for mobile navigation (React accelerator)

The React accelerator has a primary navigation that holds the top llinks for the mega menu. We've added a new block type to manage a secondary navigation that is by default only shown in mobile devices. Convenient when you wish to add for example a Login link or a customer service link that is usually not located in the promary navigation.
