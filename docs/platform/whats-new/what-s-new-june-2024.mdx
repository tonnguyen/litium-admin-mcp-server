# Litium

## Improved order search and filtering in administration

When working in customer service and other roles it is very valuable to be able to quickly find orders placed in Litium to be able to help out as quickly and efficiently as possible.

With the improved search and filter abilities it is easier for order administrators to find orders by improved search and filter abilities. The former search page for orders and campaigns is removed and instead the user is presented to the orders list page as the start page of the Sales module. The user is now presented with a search box that searches the combination of customer number, email, name, order number, payment and shipment references in the same search box. There are also two fixed filters for order date and order status. Additionally, you can add all the filters that was there before in a filter drop down. All three of these options are of course combinable, presenting a much improved search functionality and improved user experience. The search and filter settings are also remembered by the system if the user leaves the orders list and comes back.

The new order search layout with the three options free text search, fixed options as well as the advanced fiters.

## Ability to search for orders by payment or shipment references

Merchants have a strong need to find Litium orders using many different search terms. One example is for customer service where buyers do not always have the order number, but might have for example the shipment id or tracking number. Another example is id numbers in integrated systems, eg from a payment provider, that you would like to search for to find the connected Litium orders.

With the new improved search you can search also by payment or transaction references as well as shipment reference numbers including tracking numbers.

## Ability to filter order list on shipment status

Order administrator might have a need to find orders based on the shipment state. For example, you might want to see the orders that currently have at least one shipment that is "Processing".

With this new ability it is possible to filter the order list on Shipment status.

## Improved ability to see name and breadcrumbs for blocks

It is sometimes hard to find nested blocks. For example, when editing a mega menu made up from nested blocks it can be hard to navigate in the hierarchical structure to find the block you want to edit. The purpose of this feature is to make it easier to navigate in nested blocks to find the block to edit. Now, the name for a block is shown in thumbnails and in the breadcrumbs indicating the position in nested blocks are always shown in full, and not truncated.

![Skärmavbild 2024-06-24 kl. 16.30.12.png](/images/platform/whats-new/Ska%CC%88rmavbild%202024-06-24%20kl.%2016.30.12.png)

The breadcrumbs for nested blocks are now shown without being truncated.

The block's name is always visible for bot local and global blocks.

# React accelerator

The React accelerator is only available to customers running Litium Commerce Cloud and note that you can run it locally and in Litium serverless cloud.
