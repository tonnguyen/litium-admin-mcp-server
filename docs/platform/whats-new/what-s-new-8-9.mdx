Storefront API introduction

Storefront API functional areas

## Content blocks for websites

The new ability for websites to have blocks let's you create content as blocks used in other places than a page. Convenient if you, for example, would like to manage the content of the site footer or the primary navigation as a block.

You can define multiple block containers in the website template and start creating block types for the website. The blocks are added and edited in a new Blocks tab when editing the website.

##

## Nested blocks

With this new ability blocks can have nested blocks allowing more flexibility in the data modelling of your content structure. In the field template of a block you define which block types are allowed to be nested.

By allowing only certain block types, we facilitate for administrators managing the content, and minimize the risk of errors in rendering the blocks.

As an example, a footer with columns that have links, can be defined as in the image and table below using nested blocks, and used by the website entity.

## Improved UX for blocks

Consistency with new sidebar to manage blocks

The blocks management UI has been made consistent and improved. It looks and behaves the same whether you are editing a global block, blocks for pages or blocks for campaigns.

Blocks tab when editing page properties

There is a new tab showing the blocks when you are editing properties and other settings for a page, so that you don't have to leave the editing of the page properties and settings to edit the blocks.

Move blocks between containers

The name of the block containers are more visible in the UI and it is possible to drag and drop a block from one container to another.

## Set allowed block types for a block container

You can now configure which block types are allowed for a block container, increasing the control over which blocks that will be rendered in a container, and minimizing risk of rendering not being as expected.

## Faster editing by not clicking the pen icon

You don't need to click the pen icon anymore to open a field and edit it. Just start writing or adding your content.

## Smaller UI design improvements

- No lines between fields
- New UI design for tabs

## Manage filter configuration in website entity instead of in the MVC accelerator

The purpose is to move the ability to manage filter configurations to the website instead of having it in the MVC Accelerator to support headless and API first scenarios. This way the settings are accessible via the Storefront API.
