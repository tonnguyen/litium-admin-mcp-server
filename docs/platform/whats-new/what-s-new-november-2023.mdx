The React accelerator is only accessible to customers running on Litium Commerce Cloud and please note that you can run it locally and in your own development environments. Support for running it in Litium serverless cloud will come later this October.

The headless React accelerator is built on React and Next.JS and has all the tools and frameworks you would expect from a modern single page application. It is designed mobile first for a better and updated user experience.

The new react accelerator has its own description and release notes, but here are some of the new things delivered this time.

## Ability to show a product page
