## Ability for administrators to see an order timeline

Sometimes it can be hard to understand why an order has ended up in a certain state.

With the new order timeline, you can see past events for an order. This feature helps you identify where potential issues have occurred and what actions are needed to resolve them.

## Ability to filter orders on RMA status

To make it easier to locate orders with RMAs (Return Merchandise Authorizations), you can now filter the order list by RMA status.

## Ability to view RMAs in the order page

Orders often contain extensive associated information, and having a full overview is essential.

With this new feature, you can see all RMAs linked to an order directly on the order page, including detailed information about each RMA.

## Ability to view details of an RMA in the order page

Orders often contain extensive associated information, and having a full overview is essential.

With this new feature, you can see all all details about each RMA.

# Litium PIM

## Improved product search in administration

As an administrator managing a large number of products, it is crucial to quickly locate the relevant products for your tasks.

You can now search for article numbers and names using a single input field, with the option to refine your search further by applying additional filters. The input field for article numbers and names is readily accessible, eliminating the need to open a filter dropdown.

## Ability for administrators to save searches as views in Products module

An administrator commonly have a need to repeat the same search and/or filtering many times. You could for example want to filter products for a certain channel. These repeated searches are commonly related to a recurring task that needs to be done, sometimes by multiple people.

To save time and foster collaboration, users can now save product searches as reusable views for future use.

## Ability to export only filtered variants

When selecting variants to export using filters in the administration, the current behavior of the product export is to include all variants for a base product. This can be misleading, as the filtered list may display a more specific selection.

With this new feature, only the filtered variants will be exported.

# Litium usability

## Ability to use keyboard navigation in dropdowns

Using keyboard navigation offers a faster and more efficient way for power users to interact with dropdowns without having to switch between the keyboard and mouse.

You can now use the arrow keys to navigate between options in dropdowns and the enter key to select the highlighted option.

## Improved consistency in UI

When working in the administration, a consistent UI enhances user understanding and efficiency by reducing confusion and improving navigation. We have improved contrast, ensured greater consistency in the information layout across multiple areas, and introduced design refinements to make the interface more intuitive and visually appealing for users.

# Litium data modelling

## Ability to configure display groups for field templates

When setting up a product's visual representation in a storefront, a developer is often heavily involved in defining how the fields or attributes of a product are displayed.

With this new feature, you have greater flexibility in configuring where fields are displayed on a page. It is now possible to create groups of fields, called display groups, which can be used in various areas when designing a page. Once an area is linked to a display group, administrators can configure which fields should be shown in that group.

## Ability to define a display template for a field template

As a merchant it is common to have product types that have different set of attributes but share the visual representation in a storefront product page.

With this new feature, a merchant can configure which display template that should be used for a field template, meaning that several field templates can share a single display template.

# Other

## Ability to check capability of current application

With the new Litium serverless cloud we have introduced worker nodes to offload the public servers from work.

With this new feature we are adding an ApplicationCapabilityService that can be used in Litium to detect if the workload is running on the worker node.

## Ability to purge cache in Admin Web API

The ability to purge the cache for an entity is useful in scenarios where changes bypass the API and are made directly in the database. In such cases, the caches in Litium for entities may become stale, and even restarting the application might still return outdated data.

With this new feature we provide a cache endpoint for each entity, enabling users to delete cached information. This ensures that the system reloads the updated data from the database, including any custom changes made.

# Litium Storefront API

## Ability for richer search capabilities in Storefront API

To enable richer search functionality for site visitors, the Storefront API has been enhanced with additional capabilities. With this new feature, developers can customize search queries by applying n-grams, fuzziness, or boosting to individual fields. These customizations can be utilized when querying Litium for products, categories, and pages.

## Ability to dynamic return the product relationship types

Currently the relationships are only matched to the fieldGroup, and the relationship type must be predefined when the template is created.

With this new ability, as a developer, you can retrieve unspecified product relationships to dynamically build product views with various types of relationships, using the same concept as fieldGroup/fieldGroups.

## Ability to use persisted queries with Storefront API

To minimize the query size sent to the Storefront API with each request, persisted queries can be used. Instead of sending the full query, only a hash of the query is sent, which improves performance.

## Ability to define a display template for a field template

As a merchant it is common to have product types that have different set of attributes but share the visual representation in a storefront product page.

With this new feature, a merchant can configure which display template that should be used for a field template, meaning that several field templates can share a single display template.

# React accelerator

The React accelerator is only available to customers running Litium Commerce Cloud and note that you can run it locally and in Litium serverless cloud.

The headless React accelerator is built on React and Next.JS and has all the tools and frameworks you would expect from a modern single page application. It is designed mobile first for a better and updated user experience.

The new react accelerator has its own description and release notes, but here are some of the new things delivered in this release.

## Ability to show a product page with a variants list

For merchants selling products that has a larger set of similar variants, it gives a better overview to the buyer to list the variants in a table with columns for the variant attributes. With this new feature, products can be shown in the React accelerator as a page listing the variants in a table.

## Ability to configure Google Analytics using Google Tag Manager

Google Analytics helps e-commerce merchants track traffic, customer behavior, and sales performance. It provides insights into conversion rates, cart abandonment, and product trends, enabling data-driven decisions. With this feature you can set up tracking with Google Analytics by configuring it using the settings for Google Tag Manager in Litium.

## Ability to sign out using a sign out link

With this new feature a logged in user can click a link to logout from the session.

## Upgrade to Next.JS 15

From this version of the React accelerator, we support and use the NEXTJS version 15, to offer the most efficient framework to partner developers.

# Shipments API

## Ability to get shipping options from a shipping app on the checkout page

With this ability a shipping app can receive a cart from Litium and return a list of available shipping options for that cart. The options from the shipping app can either be displayed on the checkout page for the buyer to choose from, or Litium can select one based on business logic in the solution.

# Direct shipment app

## Ability to return a shipping option with integration type DeliveryOptions

With the Connect Shipment API 1.1 we add the ability for shipment apps to return available shipping options to the checkout. These options can be based on the cart context and include a custom shipping fee. With this feature we provide a demo implementation of this ability where the Direct shipment app will return a shipping option with a fee of 10 units of currency per item in the cart.
