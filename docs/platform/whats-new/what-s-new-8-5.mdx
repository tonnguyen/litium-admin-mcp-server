## Ability to set "follow" as default for new pages in CMS

With this ability the ranking in search engines like Google is improved, by instructing search engines to crawl content and links in pages as default.

## Ability to create responsive image element

With this ability performance in site speed is improved by using responsive image elements, which are used to deliver multiple versions of the same image that match different screen-sizes. The browser will select the best fit image depending on the viewport width, container width and dpi setting.

## Ability for system to add alt text on images

With this ability the alternative texts on images are set in the Accelerator by using information from the image description in Media for images for products, as well as for images in pages and blocks. This increases the the accessibility of the accelerator, but also increases the ranking in search engines such as Google.

## Ability for system to use payment provider with checkout widget without receiving address information from the widget

The behaviour of the checkout page has been changed to improve the handling of customer details. A "Continue" button has been added to the customer details form. Loading of any payment or delivery widgets are deferred until the customer details form has been completed. Also, the checkout page automatically adapts to the integration type of the configured payment and shipping options.
