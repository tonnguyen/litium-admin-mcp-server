Redis is an open-source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.

Litium uses Redis for:

- [Service bus](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub) 
    

- [Distributed caching](/platform/get-started/concepts) 
    
- [Distributed concurrency lock](https://redis.io/topics/distlock)
    

Litium is tested with Redis version 5.0.5, other versions may work but are not tested.

## Installation 

Redis is included in Litium Accelerator from version 8 but for older versions, packages for Redis can be installed from Litium's NuGet feed.

[Install the package](/platform/get-started/shared-dependencies-installing-a-nuget-package) below in the MVC project:

Litium.Web.Setup.Redis

### Configuration

The implementation contains both service bus and distributed caching. Add connection strings for the Redis-features that should be activated in appsettings.json.

The configuration is under Litium / Redis section

- _prefix_: the prefix of Redis cache.
- _cache / connectionString_: the connection string for Redis cache.
- _distributedLock/ connectionString_: the connection string for Redis distributed lock.
- _serviceBus/ connectionString_: the connection string for Redis service Bus.

```json
"Redis": {
  "Prefix": null,
  "Cache": {
    "ConnectionString": null
  },
  "DistributedLock": {
    "ConnectionString": null
  },
  "ServiceBus": {
    "ConnectionString": null
  }
}
```
