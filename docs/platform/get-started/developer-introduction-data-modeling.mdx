All Litium objects share a common data modelling framework called the field framework. An important task at the beginning of every project is to define the data models to use, and set which information needs to be stored for all entities, like products, customers or pages.

All fields in the field framework can be localized, meaning that a value for the field can be set for all languages of the installation.

Not all objects in Litium have the field framework, those that do are:

| **Area** | **Entities** |
| --- | --- |
| Media | Media object / Folder |
| Customers | Person / Group / Organization |
| Sales | \- |
| Products | Product / Category |
| Website | Website / Page / Block |
| Globalization | Market / Channel |

## Field types and fields

- A field type defines the datatype for a field (e.g. date, number or string), field types are global and all field types are available in all areas of the Litium installation. Developers can also [create custom field types](/platform/guides/data-modelling/how-to-create-custom-field-types).
    
- A field is an instance of a field type (i.e. the _field_ **brand** is of _fieldtype_ **text**). Fields are created and scoped for a specific _area_.
    

Fields created by the MVC accelerator are defined in code, see folder `\Src\Litium.Accelerator\Definitions\` in the MVC accelerator solution.

Example of a _field_ defined in code:

new FieldDefinition<CustomerArea>("SocialSecurityNumber", SystemFieldTypeConstants.Text)
{
    CanBeGridColumn = true, // Can be added as column to customer lists in Backoffice
    CanBeGridFilter = true, // Can be used to filter customer lists in Backoffice
    MultiCulture = false, // Should a field value be stored for every language?
}

## Field permissions

**Note**: These permissions are specifically applied to the [Storefront API](/platform/apis/storefront-api).

Each field has a set of permissions that define which groups of persons that can read or write the value of the field.

When a field is created without explicit permissions, the system will automatically assign the default permission that is pre-defined in System settings > Permissions > Default field permissions.

As default, read permission is automatically set for the 'Everyone' group.

For persons, it is possible to limit whether you can read or write the value of a field only if the value is for the current user's profile or organization data.

## Functional field types

As mentioned above the field type defines the data type for a field (e.g. date, number or string), but some field types do not only store data to be viewed, instead they have special functions or store references.

### Pointer

The pointer field type is used to select a specific entity, i.e. selecting a _product_ for a _news page_ or selecting a _reseller organization_ for a _product_.

- A pointer field can be _single_ or _multi select_.

Example of a pointer field defined in code:

new FieldDefinition<BlockArea>(BlockFieldNameConstants.Link,
    SystemFieldTypeConstants.Pointer)
{
    Option = new PointerOption { EntityType = PointerTypeConstants.WebsitesPage }
}

### Multifield

The multifield acts as a container for other fields (multiple fields can be added).

The multifield is also one of few field types (option-fields can be set to multi-select) that can be defined as an array. This brings a lot of value when you develop custom field types since you never have to implement array support yourself (like field UI, serialization etc.) for arrays, if a user want to use it as an array they can just wrap it in a multifield.

Say that you want to create a slideshow on the startpage, then you could create a multifield called _Slider_ and add 3 fields to it:

![Slider field.png](./media/Slider%20field.png)

By also defining the Slider-field as _array_, any number of slides can be added to the slideshow.

Example of the _slide_\-multifield defined in code:

new FieldDefinition<BlockArea>(FieldConstants.Slide,
    SystemFieldTypeConstants.MultiField)
{
    Option = new MultiFieldOption {
        IsArray = true,
        Fields = new List<string>() {
            FieldNameConstants.ImagePointer,
            FieldNameConstants.LinkText,
            FieldNameConstants.LinkToPage
        }
    }
}

## Field templates

All entities that use the field framework (e.g. person, group, product) are created using a _field template_. The _field template_ is a definition of fields that are visible when the entity is edited in backoffice.

Note that the field template does not define the fields that can be added to an entity, only which fields are _visible_. The acutal data is always added to the entity and is not removed/changed if the entity switches template.

Fields in a _field template_ are grouped together in _field groups_.

Example of a _field group_ defined in code:

new PersonFieldTemplate("MyPersonTemplate")
{
    FieldGroups = new \[\]
    {
        new FieldTemplateFieldGroup()
        {
            Id = "General",
            Collapsed = false,
            Fields =
            {
                SystemFieldDefinitionConstants.FirstName,
                SystemFieldDefinitionConstants.LastName,
                SystemFieldDefinitionConstants.Email,
                "SocialSecurityNumber"
            }
        }
    }
}

## MVC display templates

In Litium the entities **product**, **category** and **page** have landing pages. To display these landing pages you need to connect the _field templates_ of these entities to _MVC Controllers_, this connection is the _display template_.

If you inspect the _field template_ of the _Article_\-page in the settings of Litium backoffice you can see that it specifies the `Index`\-action of the `ArticleController` as _display template_.

## Baseproduct and variant URL

This setting in the field template for products, defines if URL should be set on the _baseproduct_ or the _variant_.

- A variant level url will give every variant of the baseproduct a unique url, while a baseproduct url will have a single url that will be shared between all variants.
- When using a variant level url it is possible to define how the variants of a baseproduct should be grouped in listings, the Accelerator will in default setup group varians by color so that a baseproduct with 6 variants (3 sizes in 2 colors) will only have two items in search results and listings (one for each color).
