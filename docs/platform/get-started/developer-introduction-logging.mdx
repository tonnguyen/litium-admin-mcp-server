Constructor inject `ILogger<Type>` in a class to write to the application log, then write to the log with:

\_logger.LogTrace("Creating visitor group");

- Litium uses [NLog](https://nlog-project.org/) for application logging.
- Configure log outputs in the file `\Src\Litium.Accelerator.Mvc\NLog.config`, for example to:
    - Write error-level logs to a separate file
    - Write all logs from a specific class to a separate file
    - Skip logging of non-relevant messages
