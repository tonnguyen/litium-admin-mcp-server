    dotnet new --install "Litium.Empty.Templates"
    
    After the template is installed, a list of available templates is shown_Note: To update the template to a later version, you should run the installation command again._  
      
    If you want to install a specific version of the template you need to append the version number to the template name separated by two colons (::) example for template for the 8.15.0 version
    
    dotnet new --install "Litium.Empty.Templates::8.15.0"

    dotnet litium-db update --connection "Pooling=true;User Id=user;Password=secret;Database=litium8;Server=127.0.0.1;TrustServerCertificate=True"

## Secure connection (SSL)

Every page should use a secure connection. By setting the HSTS (Http Strict Transport Security) for the domain name, we force the website to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. To configure HSTS, navigate to **Settings** > **Globalization** > **Domain names**, select a domain name, click **Edit** and then choose to edit **HSTS max age** to a value greater than 0.  
  
[From Qualys](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2016/03/28/the-importance-of-a-proper-http-strict-transport-security-implementation-on-your-web-server) it is advisable to assign the max-age directive’s value to be greater than 10368000 seconds (120 days) and ideally to 31536000 (one year). Websites should aim to ramp up the max-age value to ensure heightened security for a long duration for the current domain and/or subdomains.
