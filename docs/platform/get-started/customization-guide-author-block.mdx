Add a custom block that can display author information from an author-page

To do this task you first need to complete the task [Author page](/platform/get-started/customization-guide-author-page)

## Create a new block

Your client needs a block to present authors as blocks on the startpage.

Creating a block is very similar to creating a page

## Download resources

Create the files below:

- [AuthorBlockController.cs](https://github.com/LitiumAB/Education/blob/99ed050e4241dc15b1f7a5a74f154c880c61cb95/Developer%20Education/Tasks/Author%20block/Resources/AuthorBlockController.cs)
- [AuthorBlockTemplateSetup.cs](https://github.com/LitiumAB/Education/blob/99ed050e4241dc15b1f7a5a74f154c880c61cb95/Developer%20Education/Tasks/Author%20block/Resources/AuthorBlockTemplateSetup.cs)
- [Author.cshtml](https://github.com/LitiumAB/Education/blob/99ed050e4241dc15b1f7a5a74f154c880c61cb95/Developer%20Education/Tasks/Author%20block/Resources/Author.cshtml)
- [AuthorBlockViewModelBuilder.cs](https://github.com/LitiumAB/Education/blob/99ed050e4241dc15b1f7a5a74f154c880c61cb95/Developer%20Education/Tasks/Author%20block/Resources/AuthorBlockViewModelBuilder.cs)

## Allow automated template updates from code

Templates are only created/updated from code the first time the application starts. Follow the instructions in [Author page task](/platform/get-started/customization-guide-author-page) to make Litium update templates from their coded definition on **every** startup.

## Create a definition that will generate the template on startup

1.  Add _Author_ to `Litium.Accelerator.Constants.BlockTemplateNameConstants`
2.  Create the file `\Src\Litium.Accelerator\Definitions\Blocks\AuthorBlockTemplateSetup.cs` with content from the file downloaded earlier.
    
    The block only has a Name property and a LinkToPage property, the LinkToPage will be used to select an author page that the block will display content from.
    
3.  Add translations for the block in `\Src\Litium.Accelerator.Administration.Extensions\Resources\Administration.resx`:
    
    | Key | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | `fieldtemplate.blockarea.author.name` | Author block |
    | `fieldtemplate.blockarea.author.fieldgroup.general.name` | General author block settings |
    

## 4\. Create Controller, ViewModel and View needed to display the block

1.  Create the file `\Src\Litium.Accelerator\Builders\Block\AuthorBlockViewModelBuilder.cs` with content from the file downloaded earlier
    
    The Author block will contain the same information as the Author page created earlier so you can re-use the AuthorViewModel instead of creating a new one
    
2.  Create the file `\Src\Litium.Accelerator.Mvc\Controllers\Blocks\AuthorBlockController.cs` with content from the file downloaded earlier
3.  Create the file `\Src\Litium.Accelerator.Mvc\Views\Blocks\Author.cshtml` with content from the file downloaded earlier

## Link the definition to the controller

The link will tell Litium which controller to use to render blocks using the Author template definition.

1.  Add _Author_ to the `_controllerMapping`\-dictionary in `Litium.Accelerator.Mvc.Definitions.FieldTemplateSetupDecorator`:
    
    \[(typeof(Blocks.BlockArea), BlockTemplateNameConstants.Author)\] = (typeof(AuthorBlockController), nameof(AuthorBlockController.Invoke))
    

## Try it out

1.  Build your solution and open Litium backoffice
2.  Select _Websites_ in top menu, select _Home page_ in left menu and select _Blocks_ from the "..."-menu in the top right corner
3.  Click **Add blocks**
4.  Drag an instance of your Author-block out to the block area
5.  In the "Link to page"-property select your previously created Author-page
6.  Quick publish the page from the "..."-menu in the top right corner
7.  Go to the start page of the public site and review your block

## Optional task - Validate page template

To prevent other pages than those using the Author template to be selected you can implement validation as described in the [Validation task](/platform/get-started/customization-guide-field-and-validation)

## Next step

This was the last step of the tutorial.
