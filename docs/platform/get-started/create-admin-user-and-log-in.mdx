Accounts for admin pages and public site.

## Adding admin user

When running Litium in a non-windows environment you cannot use the windows credentials to log in. Instead, you need to create an admin user directly in the database. Use the _user_ command from _litium-db_ to create the admin user.

dotnet litium-db user --connection \[connectionstring\] --login username --password pasword

if you have the connection string in your json-config file you can directly use that to add the admin user

dotnet litium-db user --file \[path to the config.json file\] --login username --password password

## Administration login

The Windows account login works for the Litium administration login page.

Login with Windows accounts belonging to the administrator group on the server or the developer machine, if you are working in projects on Windows OS. 

No accounts will be created in Litium for this login. Technically, you will be logged in as _System_ with full permissions. 

## Log in to the public site

To log in on the public site, you need a regular Litium account.

This means that the administration login page handles login both with Windows credentials and Litium credentials.

To know when a Windows account should be used, the username should contain a backslash (\\) to separate the domain and the username in a Windows pre-2000 mode.

To be able to log in you need to access your site over encrypted communication (https).
