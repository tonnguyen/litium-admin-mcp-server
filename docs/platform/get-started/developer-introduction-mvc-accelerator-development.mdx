The Litium MVC Accelerator is structured with a clear separation of business logic from presentation to make it possible to replace the MVC UI if needed.

## Solution structure

When Litium is installed a new Visual Studio solution is created with 5 projects (an additional e-mail project is also created). This is the Accelerator source code that can be modified in the implementation project.

The more changes you make to the codebase the bigger the project will be to upgrade to new Accelerator versions, so there is a balance when doing modifications. Changes made in the Accelerator codebase are documented in the [Accelerator release notes](/accelerators/mvc-accelerator/release-notes-mvc-accelerator) (separated from the [Litium platform release notes](/platform/change-log/release-notes)).

### Litium.Accelerator-project

The `Litium.Accelerator`\-project is the _BLL_ (Business logic layer) that contains all logic separated from the UI and Web API, for example:

- ViewModels and ViewModelBuilders
- Definitions
- Services
- Validations

This project has most of the Litium NuGet references.

### Litium.Accelerator.Administration.Extensions-project

Contains customizations of the Litium backoffice UI, for example [custom settings pages](/platform/guides/back-office-ui-extensions/how-to-create-a-custom-page-under-settings) that are part of the Accelerator.

### Litium.Accelerator.Elasticsearch-project

Contains the implementation of Elasticsearch, modify this code if you need to:

- Modify what data is stored in the index
- Modify how queries are executed against the index data

### Litium.Accelerator.FiledTypes-project

Contains custom field types for Litiums entity field framework. The Accelerator contains one custom field called _FilterField_ that is used to control which fields should be included in category filters.

Modify this project if you want to [add your own custom field types](/platform/guides/data-modelling/how-to-create-custom-field-types).

### Litium.Accelerator.MVC-project

The web project containing standard MVC files such as [Controllers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/controllers-and-routing/aspnet-mvc-controllers-overview-cs) and [Razor Views](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/overview?view=aspnetcore-6.0), but also:

- The Web API controllers used by the Accelerator React UI.
- A `/Definitions`\-folder with the links between Field Templates and controllers
- A `/Client`\-folder with all styles and JavaScript
- [Configuration](/platform/get-started/configuration) and package reference files

### Litium.Accelerator.Email-project

This project can be found when looking in the solution folder on disk but is not included in the Visual Studio solution.

[Client side project to manage e-mail templates](/accelerators/mvc-accelerator/develop/front-end-coding/accelerator-email) (Order confirmation e-mail)

[Zurb Foundation for Emails](https://get.foundation/emails/docs/) is used for styling.

## Litium search

Litium search is the search engine used in Litium Accelerator. It is built on [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) with additional plugins and administration interface. Litium search runs as a separate application and a single search engine is used for all web servers in a multiserver installation.

A new Accelerator installation contains indicies for:

- Pages
- Categories
- Products
- Purchase history

[Additional search indicies can also be created if needed](/platform/guides/litiumsearch/how-to-add-a-search-index)

Synonyms for Litium search can be added directly in Litium backoffice, by adding the sample below a query for _trousers_ will also give search hits for _pants_, _chinos_ and _leggings_.

## MVC Accelerator front-end

The front-end code can be found in the `Client`\-folder in the MVC-project.

### Accelerator front-end tech stack

- [Foundation Zurb](https://get.foundation/) - Used as front-end framework
    
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Used as CSS preprocessor
    
- [BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)](http://getbem.com/introduction/) - Used as naming methodology for structured CSS
    
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - Used to build the JavaScript components
    
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Used to build and bundle the frontend styles and scripts

### State on the client

To give the stateless Web API controllers access to the current Litium state (current page/channel/product), Litium passes that information in every request as the `RequestContext`:

1.  In the shared view `\Shared\Framework\ClientContext.cshtml` the global object **`window.__litium.requestContext`** is written to every rendered MVC-page in the Accelerator. If you try the command below in the browsers JavaScript console on a Accelerator-page
    
    \> window.\_\_litium.requestContext
    
    ...you can see the current `RequestContext`\-object:
    
    {
        "channelSystemId": "9256cc22-2b93-4a4e-bfa9-04dc51ec4b05",
        "currentPageSystemId": "2df58068-fe4b-40b9-851f-c49cd4f3f2bc",
        "productCategorySystemId": "01015225-c6a8-4bac-ae17-834cf7617016"
    }
    
2.  The React `http`\-service is used when ajax-requests are created on the client. It serializes and attaches `window.__litium.requestContext` as a header to every request:
    
    // from \\Src\\Litium.Accelerator.Mvc\\Client\\Scripts\\Services\\http.js
    
    headers: {
        'litium-request-context': JSON.stringify(window.\_\_litium.requestContext),
    }
    
3.  When requests are received on the server Litium looks for the `litium-request-context`\-header, and if the header is found its data is stored and made available in `RequestModelAccessor`.
    
    // from \\Src\\Litium.Accelerator.Mvc\\Runtime\\RequestModelActionFilter.cs
    var siteSettingViewModel = request.Headers.GetSiteSettingViewModel();
    
4.  Any Web API Controller (for example `CheckoutController`) can then inject and use `RequestModelAccessor` to get state for the request
    
    public CheckoutController(RequestModelAccessor requestModelAccessor ...
    {
        ...
