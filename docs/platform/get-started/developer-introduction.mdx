This document is for developers that are new to Litium. It is recommended that you first read the Concepts page to get a general understanding of the platform.

## Technologies used

- Litium CDN powered by [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) handles all requests when the site has been deployed to Litium cloud.
    
- Client side frameworks
    
    - Litium react accelerator is built with [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](http://reactjs.org/) as a single page application.
        
    - Litium MVC accelerator is built as a [Microsoft .NET MVC](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/mvc) on [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/), with dynamic parts built with [React](http://reactjs.org/).
        
    - [Angular](https://angular.io/) is used to build the SPA that is the Litium backoffice.
        
- The database used is [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server).
    
- The search engine Litium search is built on [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).
    
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) in-memory data store is used for:
    
    - [Distributed cache](/platform/architecture/distributed-caching)
    - Distributed locks prevent other applications and threads from accessing a section of code that should not have multiple simultaneous executions.
    - [Service bus](/platform/architecture/service-bus)
    - Session management
    - The [Redis-task on GitHub](https://github.com/LitiumAB/Education/tree/main/Developer%20Education/Tasks/Redis#1-distributed-cache) has a sample on implementing distributed cache and lock
- [Automapper](https://docs.automapper.org/) is used to map data between similar objects, mainly to map data from the general object to MVC ViewModels, example:

```csharp
// 1. Register mapping:
cfg.CreateMap<PageModel, ArticleViewModel>()
  .ForMember(x => x.Title, m => m.MapFromField(PageFieldNameConstants.Title))
  .ForMember(x => x.Text, m => m.MapFromField(PageFieldNameConstants.Text))
  .ForMember(x => x.Image, m => m.MapFrom<ImageModelResolver>());

// 2. Then use:
var articleViewModel = pageModel.MapTo<ArticleViewModel>();
```

## License

A license is not required to setup a Litium installation on your local computer, but without a license file Litium will limit the number of requests per minute when the site is accessed from a machine other than localhost.

When you deploy to test/stage/prod environments you will need a license-file:

- The license must cover all environments (test/prod/stage) that customers have access to
    
- [Request a license file](/resources/support/request-license)
