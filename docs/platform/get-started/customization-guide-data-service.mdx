Use data service to get actual products for an author based on the author field

> To do this task you first need to complete the tasks [Field and validation](/platform/get-started/customization-guide-field-and-validation) and [Author service](/platform/get-started/customization-guide-author-service).

## Search products with DataService

Until now the list of books for authors has been hard coded but with your new field you can load all books for an author from PIM.

1.  Inject `Litium.Data.DataService` into the constructor of `AuthorServiceImpl`
2.  See the [page about the data service](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/architecture/data-service) and write a query that returns all **BaseProducts** where the **Author**\-field has the `authorPageId` that is passed to the `GetBooksByAuthor`\-method
3.  Get and return the name-property for all BaseProducts returned from your query (`book.Localizations.CurrentCulture.Name`)
4.  [A finished example can be downloaded here](https://github.com/LitiumAB/Education/blob/99ed050e4241dc15b1f7a5a74f154c880c61cb95/Developer%20Education/Tasks/Data%20service/Resources/AuthorServiceImpl.cs)

## Try it out

1.  Open the startpage and verify that the _AuthorBlock_ created earlier now shows products from PIM where the author selected in the block is set as author.
2.  Modify products in PIM to verify that changes to the _author_ field is reflected in the book listing of the author block.

## Optional task: Cache

Data service should **never** be used in production without a cache, inject and use [IDistributedCache](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/get-started/multi-server-installation) to cache the books for a limited time.

## Next step

[Add a custom Web API to allow external systems to get book titles](/platform/get-started/customization-guide-web-api)
