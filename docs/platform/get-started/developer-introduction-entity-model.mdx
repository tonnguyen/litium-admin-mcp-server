Entities (e.g. person, group or page) in Litium are accessed and modified using the entitys _service_.

- The service is named as the entity with the Service-suffixe (i.ex. _**Page**Service_)
- The service contains methods to get, create, update and delete the entity
- The service is accessed using _dependency injection_

Example:

public abstract class ChannelService : IEntityService<Channel>, IEntityAllService<Channel>
{
    public abstract void Create(Channel channel);
    public abstract void Delete(Channel channel);
    public abstract Channel Get(Guid systemId);
    public abstract IEnumerable<Channel> Get(IEnumerable<Guid> systemIds);
    public abstract IEnumerable<Channel> GetAll();
    public abstract void Update(Channel channel);
}

## Modify entity

- When an entity is retreived from Litium it is always in _read-only_ mode (because cached entities should be non modifiable)
    
- If you want to modify the entity you need to create a new writable version by calling `MakeWritableClone()` then use the entity service to update, example:
    

person = person.MakeWritableClone();
person.LoginCredential.NewPassword = newPassword;
\_personService.Update(person);
