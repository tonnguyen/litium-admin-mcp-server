## Required dependencies

From Litium 8 it is mandatory with the following services. This to always ensure that the solution is compliant with Litium serverless cloud.

For hosting in Litium LOD environment API version of Elasticsearch is 7.6.2 version, otherwise the 7.17.9 version. For local development use the 7.17.9 version but ensure that no functions that come after 7.6.2 is used if your project is hosted on LOD.
- Requires the site to have HTTPS for login to work (also required for test environments).
