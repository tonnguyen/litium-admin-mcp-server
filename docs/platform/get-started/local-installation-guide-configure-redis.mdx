Connect Litium to the Redis container

To do this task you first need to complete the [Docker task](/platform/get-started/local-installation-guide-setup-docker)

## Configuration

A container with Redis was set up in the Docker task, you just need to add the connection.

Make the changes below in the Redis section in `appsettings.json`:

1.  Set connectionstring for _Cache_, _DistributedLock_ and _ServiceBus_ to `localhost:6379`
2.  Set _Prefix_ to `LitiumTutorial`. By setting a value for _Prefix_ you can use the same Redis container for multiple local Litium installations - just use a unique prefix for each installation.

Finished example:

"Redis": {
   "Prefix": "LitiumTutorial",
   "Cache": {
      "ConnectionString": "localhost:6379",
      "Password": null
   },
   "DistributedLock": {
      "ConnectionString": "localhost:6379",
      "Password": null
   },
   "ServiceBus": {
      "ConnectionString": "localhost:6379",
      "Password": null
   }
}

Optionally you can also adjust cache-settings to limit the time items are stored in Redis (this is useful for local testing but keep the long cache times in production):

"Cache": {
    "Distributed": {
        "DefaultMemorySlidingExpiration": 120,
        "DefaultDistributedSlidingExpiration": 600
    }
}

Additional cache configuration options can be found in the [Configuration](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/get-started/configuration) page.

## Verify

After startup you can use a tool such as for example [Another Redis Desktop Manager](https://github.com/qishibo/AnotherRedisDesktopManager) to connect to Redis and view, delete or edit the data stored in Redis. The data is stored encrypted and not human readable.
