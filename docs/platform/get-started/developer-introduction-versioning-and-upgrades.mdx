All Litium custumers have independent installations and many of these are not yet upgraded to the latest version 8. A short background is useful to better understand the architecture when maintaining older installations.

The current Litium version 8 has a SPA-backoffice and a modern, testable, service based architecture built using the latest version of .NET. Litium version 4 had an outdated architecture, dependencies on .NET Framework and needed a full rewrite, but instead of rewriting the entire platform at once this was done in steps.

- Litium 5 (2016) was the starting point of the _new_ Litium where the product database was rewritten into the new _Products_\-area (PIM)
- Litium 6 (2018) was the rewrite of the areas _Media_ and _Customers_
- Litium 7 (2018) was the rewrite of the _Website_\-area (CMS) and the new _Globalization_\-area was added
- Litium 8 (2021) was the final step with the last area _Sales_ being rewritten, with this final step the last dependencies on some old technology was lost:
    - The old .NET Framework could be replaced by .NET (Core) 6
    - The old Lucene search engine could be removed entirely from the codebase

So depending on which version of Litium you work with you will find different architectures in the different areas depending on which has been rewritten in that version.

## Coming functionality and roadmap

You can find information about features currently in development in the [roadmap](/resources/roadmap).

## Upgrading

A Litium Solution is upgraded in three steps:

1.  The Litium platform is upgraded using NuGet update to upgrade all packages to the latest version
    
2.  The database is upgraded using the [Litium db-tool](/platform/get-started/developer-tools-db-tool)
    
    - Use a connectionstring to upgrade instantly or generate a script to upgrade manually
        
    - There is no "downgrade" so make sure you have a saved backup before running the upgrade
        
3.  Upgrading Litium Accelerator is manual
    
    - This is likely a big task depending on how big the gap is between the old and new version
        
    - The latest released Accelerator can be used as reference but the task to merge the modified solution with the new Accelerator sourcecode is still likely a big task
