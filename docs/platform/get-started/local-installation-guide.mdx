The tasks below will guide you through a local Litium installation, including the MVC Accelerator. The installation will be complete with ElasticSearch, Redis and XUnit test project configured. You can then proceed to the customization guide to try some common customizations for your installation.

The tutorial is tested in Windows only, it may work on additional platforms but this is currently not tested or supported.  
Some tasks assume that a previous task has been completed (dependencies are presented in each tasks description), the recommended order to do them is listed below.

If something is not working in your setup it may be because of a missed step, please double-check the guide again and if you have any questions please ask them in [Litium forum](https://forum.litium.com).

## Preparations

Check that you have completed the requirements below before you start.

1.  Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) so that you can run containers
2.  [Configure access to Litium's Docker images](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/get-started/litium-packages) so that you can download the required images from Litium
3.  Litium is only distributed through NuGet, so you also need to [configure the Litium NuGet feed](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/get-started/litium-packages) (requires a [Litium Docs account](https://docs.litium.com/system_pages/createlitiumaccount) with partner privileges).
4.  Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) for the development (older versions will not work)
5.  It is also recommended to use version control to track modifications, see [Litiums recommended branching strategy](https://docs.litium.com/accelerators/mvc-accelerator/maintenance-and-upgrade) for recommendations on how to work with branches for easier code maintenance.

## Setup and configuration

The steps below will give you a full production-like installation of a new Bookstore website. You will have a working site already after the _Setup Litium MVC Accelerator_ step, but it is recommended to do all steps to get a local development environment that is as similar as possible to the production environment where the site will be hosted later.

1.  [Certificate](/platform/get-started/local-installation-guide-certificate)
2.  [Setup Docker](/platform/get-started/local-installation-guide-setup-docker)
3.  [Setup Litium MVC Accelerator](/platform/get-started/local-installation-guide-setup-litium-mvc-accelerator)
4.  [Configure Litium search](/platform/get-started/local-installation-guide-configure-litium-search)
5.  [Configure payment and shipment apps](/platform/get-started/local-installation-guide-configure-payment-and-shipment-apps)
6.  [Configure Redis](/platform/get-started/local-installation-guide-configure-redis)
7.  [Configure SMTP](/platform/get-started/local-installation-guide-configure-smtp)
8.  [Configure test project](/platform/get-started/local-installation-guide-configure-test-project)

When the setup and configuration is done it is time to do some common customizations on your Bookstore. Head on over to the Customizations guide to get started.
