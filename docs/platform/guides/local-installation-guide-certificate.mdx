Configure a local SSL-certificate to use through the tutorial

## Create certificate

A local certificate is required to allow the Docker containers added in the next task to communicate over `https`.

Please see the article [Custom developer certificate](/platform/get-started/custom-developer-certificate) for detailed information. Use this article to:

1.  Create the `ca.txt` and `localhost.txt` files.
2.  Execute the PowerShell-script (in the folder where you created the files from step 1), this script will:
    1.  Get the current folder
    2.  Generate a certificate-file and a key-file
    3.  Generate a random password to use for the certificate pfx-file
    4.  Export a pfx-file containing the certificate and the key, protected by your generated password
    5.  Import the exported pfx file into user certificates on your computer
    6.  Make the certificate "trusted" (to avoid certificate errors in your browser)
    7.  Cleanup by removing all generated files in current folder
