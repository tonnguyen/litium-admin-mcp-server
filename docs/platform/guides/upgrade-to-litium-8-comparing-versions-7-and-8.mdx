## Changed behaviours

### Order states

The order states are fixed in version 8 and custom states cannot be added. The reason for this is to ensure stability and scalability. The order process is a business critical flow and vulnerable to customizations. Instead we've introduced a framework where you can mark orders, payments and deliveries with different tags, which are useful for adapting Litium to custom business logic. 

### Discount and campaign logic extensibility

In Litium 8 you can no longer extend the campaigns to build your own discount logic. The reason for this is to ensure stability and scalability. The discount calculations is a business critical area and vulnerable to customizations.

### Discount conditions

In Litium 8 you no longer add conditions the way it was done in Litium 7. The conditions can still be set, but you add them in different ways.

### **Only one product discount price is returned per product (from version 8.6)**

You can set up as many discounts as you wish for a product, but only one discounted price is returned by the API. Litium will return the lowest discount price in the given context.

### **Order total condition moved to discount settings**

The order total condition indicated the sum of an order that needed to be exceeded for a discount to be valid. Instead of as in Litium 7, adding a condition for a campaign, this condition is moved to be a setting directly on the discount.

### "User belongs to..." conditions moved to discount settings

These conditions indicate the organizations (company), user groups or target groups for which the discount is valid. Instead of as in Litium 7, adding conditions for a campaign, these conditions are moved to be settings directly on the discount in a settings group called audience.

### "Has product..." conditions moved to target groups

These conditions indicate what products need to be in the cart for a discount to be valid. Instead of as in Litium 7, adding conditions for a campaign, these conditions are moved to be set using a connection to a target group, which in turn has these conditions.

### Voucher codes becomes discount codes

Voucher codes are renamed to discount codes in Litium 8 and will be a setting available on each discount.
