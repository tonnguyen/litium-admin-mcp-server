How to run an upgrade to Litium 8 using the .NET Upgrade Assistant.

1. [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)

2. [Install](#installation)

3. [Analyze dependencies](#analyze dependencies)

4\. [Run the .NET Upgrade Assistant](#run the .net upgrade assistant)

See the [.NET Upgrade Assistant steps](#.net upgrade assistant steps)

5\. Complete migration to [upgrade the solution](#upgrade the solution). Note that this is the main and most time-consuming bulk of the work.

6. Configure [Litium app proxy](/platform/guides/upgrade-to-litium-8-upgrade-the-platform-solution-litium-app-proxy)

❗️ Make sure that you have a backup.

The .NET Upgrade Assistant will backup the project in the first step after running. Still, we recommend that you have a backup of your database and any other files before you start. 

❗️ Make sure that you have taken all precautions necessary to be able to roll back the upgrade procedure.

### 1\. Pre-requisites

[Configure the Litium NuGet feed](/platform/get-started/litium-packages) [Litium packages](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/get-started/litium-packages). 

The .NET Upgrade Assistant requires that your project builds, which may include installing [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) in order to upgrade to .NET 6.

It also requires a recent version of MS Build to be installed, in order to work with project files. MS Build can be installed by installing Visual Studio 2022.

### 2\. Install

Install the [.NET Upgrade tool](http://www.nuget.org/packages/upgrade-assistant/) [from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/upgrade-assistant/) as a .NET CLI tool by running:

dotnet tool install -g upgrade-assistant

❗️ Invalid or authenticated sources in [NuGet configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/configuring-nuget-behavior) may cause installation problems.

### 3\. Analyze dependencies

Analyze your project dependencies by navigating to the directory containing your project or solution, and run the following command:

```bash
upgrade-assistant analyze <path-to-project-or-solution>
```

Change `<path-to-project-or-solution>` in the commands on this page to the path and name of your solution or project file.

### 4\. Run the .NET Upgrade Assistant

Run the following command to start upgrading your project:

```bash
upgrade-assistant upgrade <path-to-project-or-solution>
```

### \- .NET Upgrade Assistant steps

When you run the .NET upgrade assistant it will show you the following steps:

1\. Backup project

A backup is created by the .NET Upgrade Assistant. You can choose to skip this step if you have already created the backup.

2\. Convert project file to SDK style

3\. Update TFM (target framework moniker)

4\. Update NuGet packages

5\. Add template file

6\. Migrate app config files

7\. Update C# source

The information about the steps above was last updated upon the release of Litium 8.4 (2022-05-31). Please see the [.NET Upgrade Assistant for more information](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant).

### 5\. Upgrade the solution

Note that this is the main and most time-consuming bulk of the work. 

Most things cannot be upgraded automatically by using the Assistant and must be manually converted.

Analyzers are included in the .NET Upgrade Assistant to help you identify some of the remaining changes needed.

After the analyzers evaluate your code, you can let the Upgrade assistant automatically convert your solution to ASP.NET Core.

Please note, however, that many tasks are not fully automated, and that the analyzer also works on an already-converted solution.

Also, note that the solution will most probably not build until you have manually completed the migration steps.

### 6\. Configure the Litium app proxy
