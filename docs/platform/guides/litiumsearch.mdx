Instructions on how to setup and configure Litium search, as well as how to add a search index. 

### Litium search is powered by Elasticsearch

Litium search uses Elasticsearch as the search engine for searching Litium entities. 

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) is a third-party product that is specialized in fast distributed searches.

In the Accelerator deafult implementation, the search returns hits for products, categories and pages. Content of a blocks are treated as parts of the page they reside in, so if there is a search match in the block of a page, that page will be returned as a search hit.

Litium search is used as a centralized search index for multiple web fronts in a multi-server environment, which generates the same result for the same search request for a site. 

For more information, please see the documentation pages for [.NET clients for Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/net-api/current/index.html).
