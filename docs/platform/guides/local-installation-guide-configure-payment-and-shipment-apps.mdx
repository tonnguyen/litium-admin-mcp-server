Connect the Litium apps running in separate containers

# About Litium Apps

You need to configure payment and shipment methods before you can place orders on the checkout page. These methods are usually provided by an integration to a third-party system, such as a payment provider or transport adminstration system. Integrations to these services are provided through [Litium Apps](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/litium-apps).

Litium provides two default apps that can be used without a third-party system to integrate to, called Direct Payment and Direct Shipment.

The containers started in the previous _Docker_ task can all be re-used for multiple local Litium installations, but _Litium Apps_ need to be unique and new containers need to be created for each Litium installation. During app installation, each app instance registers itself to one (and only one) Litium instance. Once an app has been installed, that apps install link will not work again until the app is cleared and all its data removed).

If you need to clear an app for re-installation just follow these steps:

1.  Stop the container of the app you want to re-install
2.  Open the folder where you keep the `docker-compose.yaml` for the container
3.  In the `/data`\-subfolder of that folder you will find a `direct-payment` and a `direct-shipment` folder, delete the one you want to clear
4.  Start the container again and retry the install link

## Certificate

1.  Open a terminal or command window in the directory where you downloaded the _docker-compose.yaml_\-file
    
2.  Execute the command below to create a certificate file based on the certificate created in [the previous task](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-certificate). Additional info about certificates can be found in the section about [Litium Apps](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/litium-apps).
    
    ```bash
    dotnet dev-certs https -ep ./data/https/localhost.pfx -p SuperSecretPassword
    ```
    
    **Optionally** you can replace _SuperSecretPassword_ with your own password, but if you do you also need to replace the password where it is used in the `docker-compose.yaml`\-file:
    
    ```bash
    ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password=SuperSecretPassword # TODO replace if you changed the password
    ```
    
    Adjust for both _direct-payment_ and _direct-shipment_
    

## App container setup

The proper container settings for each Litium App is available in the documentation for each app.

1.  Create a new empty file called `docker-compose.yaml` (you can for example put this in your solution-directory)
    
2.  Open the documentation page for the [Direct Payment app](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/litium-apps/direct-payment)
    
3.  Copy the container specification text into your `docker-compose.yaml`\-file
    1.  Replace `${CERT_PWD}` with `SuperSecretPassword`
    2.  Replace `customer.localtest.me` with `bookstore.localtest.me`
4.  Create a new file called `direct-payment-config.json` and add the **Configuration file** content from the same Direct Payment app documentation page
5.  Open the documentation page for the [Direct Shipment app](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/litium-apps/direct-shipment)
    
6.  Copy the container specification text (except the top two lines) into your `docker-compose.yaml`\-file
    1.  Replace `${CERT_PWD}` with `SuperSecretPassword`
    2.  Replace `customer.localtest.me` with `bookstore.localtest.me`
7.  Create a new file called `direct-shipment-config.json` and add the **Configuration file** content from the same Direct Shipment app documentation page
8.  The completed `docker-compose.yaml`\-file should have this general structure:
    
    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:

      direct-payment:
        image: ...
        ...

      direct-shipment:
        image: ...
        ...
    ```
    
9.  Start a terminal or console in the folder of your new `docker-compose.yaml`\-file and run the command below to start the payment and shipment containers
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    
    (if you get the warning _"WARNING: Found orphan containers..."_ just ignore it). Tips on troubleshooting docker containers can be found in the [Docker task](https://start.litium.dev/tutorials/installation/Docker)
    
10.  The following containers is started:
     
     | **Container** | **Port** |
     | --- | --- |
     | Direct payment | 10011 |
     | Direct shipment | 10021 |
     

## Add payment methods

Follow these steps to create and configure the Direct Payment app:

1.  To initialize the app, navigate to the Direct Payment app at [https://customer-app-direct-payment.localtest.me:10011](https://customer-app-direct-payment.localtest.me:10011/). This will open the installation view in Litium backoffice of your Litium application:
    
    ![payment-app-created.jpg](/images/platform/guides/payment-app-created.jpg)
2.  Click _install_ in the above view
    
3.  In the next view click _Select file_ under _Configuration_ and select the file `direct-payment-config.json` that you created earlier.
    
4.  Click _Save_.
    

# Add shipments

Follow these steps to create and configure the Direct Shipment app:

1.  To initialize the app, navigate to the Direct Shipment app at [https://customer-app-direct-shipment.localtest.me:10021](https://customer-app-direct-shipment.localtest.me:10021/). This will open the installation view in Litium backoffice of your Litium application:
    
    ![shipment-app-created.jpg](/images/platform/guides/shipment-app-created.jpg)
2.  Click _Install_ in the above view
    
3.  In the next view click _Select file_ under _Configuration_ and select the file `direct-shipment-config.json` that you created earlier.
    
4.  Click _Save_.
    

## Configure the channel

In the control panel in Litium backoffice select _Globalization > Channels_

1.  Edit your _Bookstore_ channel
2.  Select the _Countries_ tab
3.  Sweden should already be available otherwise add it as country
4.  Click _Add payment method_ and select _DirectPayment:DirectPay_
5.  Click _Add shipping method_ and select both _DirectShipment:expressPackage_ and _DirectShipment:standardPackage_
6.  Click _Save_.

## Try it out

1.  Navigate to your public website
2.  Add some items in cart and navigate to checkout
3.  Verify that both delivery and payment mehods are available in checkout
