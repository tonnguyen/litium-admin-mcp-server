There are three upgrade alternatives to choose from.

Please see [what to consider before upgrading](/platform/guides/upgrade-to-litium-8-before-upgrading) if you need additional information on ability changes in order to choose an alternative. 

For an overview of the upgrade procedure, please see [how to upgrade to Litium 8](https://docs.litium.com/!b4353f6c-fc24-4afb-8a66-7a7e77fff13c/documentation/upgrade-to-litium-8). 

### Alternative A

### Upgrade the platform solution. Use the current database.

All custom functionality that references parts of the Litium API that is no longer available, needs to be re-written.

### Alternative B

### Make a clean install of Litium. Discard the current solution. Keep the current database.

Only code in use will be moved to the new solution, making this a good opportunity to clean an existing solution of all unused code.

Platform solution: The existing layout and functionality in the old solution that you want to keep, need to be migrated and adapted into the new templates.

### Alternative C

### Make a clean install of Litium. Discard the current solution and the current database.

Platform solution: The existing layout and functionality in the old solution that you want to keep, need to be migrated and adapted into the new templates.

Database: You must use the database migration scripts to migrate data from the old database.
