Apps can manage their extensions declaratively through the app manifest. Add an `extensions` array to the manifest file and describe each extension using the same structure documented on the [`Managing extensions`](./back-office-ui-extensions-managing-extensions) page. This keeps extension metadata together with the app that owns it.

## Target URLs

When a target definition includes a field named `url`, the placeholder `{appurl}` can be used. At runtime Litium resolves and replaces it with the app URL from the app configuration.

In Litium Serverless Cloud the app URL is automatically set to the deployed app's domain, ensuring the extension target points to the correct environment without extra configuration.
