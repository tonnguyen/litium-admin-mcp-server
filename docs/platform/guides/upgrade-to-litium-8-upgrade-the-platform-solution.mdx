How to upgrade the platform solution using the .NET Upgrade Assistant.

For an overview of the upgrade procedure, please see [how to upgrade to Litium 8](/platform/guides/upgrade-to-litium-8). 

When upgrading a .NET application and your Litium platform solution, there is a Microsoft tool that has been launched for this particular purpose. The instructions below are based on using that tool. More [information about the upgrade assistant](/platform/guides/upgrade-to-litium-8-upgrade-the-platform-solution--net-upgrade-assistant) [can be found in Microsoft's documentation](/platform/guides/upgrade-to-litium-8-upgrade-the-platform-solution--net-upgrade-assistant). 

1\. [Upgrade to Litium 8 using the .NET Upgrade Assistant](#).

Please find an overview of the [.NET Upgrade Assistant steps here](/platform/guides/upgrade-to-litium-8-upgrade-the-platform-solution-upgrade-solution-steps#.net%20upgrade%20assistant%20steps).

2\. Solve any code issues, such as dependencies on .NET 4 components that do not support .NET 5 and later versions. 

3\. Complete the [upgrade of the solution](/platform/guides/upgrade-to-litium-8-upgrade-the-platform-solution-upgrade-solution-steps). Many things cannot be upgraded automatically by using the Assistant and must be manually converted. 

Note that the main bulk of the work is to upgrade the solution after you have run the upgrade assistant.
