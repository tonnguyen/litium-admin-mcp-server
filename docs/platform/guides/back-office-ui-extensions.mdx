Extension management in Litium allows developers to enhance and customize the platform by introducing new features or modifying existing ones. With Litium's decoupled extensions, these enhancements can function independently of the core platform, offering significant benefits.

- **Simplify updates:** Extensions can be updated, replaced, or removed without impacting the core system, enabling smoother platform upgrades.
- **Enhance scalability:** Developers can innovate and deploy features more quickly, as extensions are developed independently.
- **Boost stability:** By isolating extensions from the core, they minimize risks of bugs or conflicts during updates.

A key advantage of Litium's decoupled extensions is their **distribution flexibility**. Extensions can be distributed:

- **As private apps:** Purpose-built additions tailored for a specific customer.
- **As public apps:** Shared broadly to promote community-driven innovation.

In Litium 8, extensions support extending the backoffice Angular framework through **federated modules**. These modules can surface as **area panels** or **settings items**, giving teams flexibility to tailor the backoffice UI to specific needs. Future releases will expand the integration points further.

This decoupled approach empowers developers and partners to extend Litium's functionality while maintaining platform stability and addressing tailored requirements.
