An overview of things to consider before an upgrade to Litium 8, such as new abilities, what can and cannot be migrated, existing limitations, and other changes from previous versions.  

Litium 8 uses Microsoft .NET 6 as its technical platform framework. Please see the [Microsoft documentation for additional information about upgrading to a newer version of .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/compatibility/breaking-changes). 

There are changes in the Litium platform to consider when assessing both the scope of an upgrading project and the optimal time to proceed. Below you will find three reference documents: [Changes from version to version of Litium](#), [Changes to consider before migrating sales data](/platform/guides/upgrade-to-litium-8-before-upgrading-sales-in-litium-8), including discounts and state transitions, and some general things to consider [before you upgrade a solution with integrations](/platform/guides/upgrade-to-litium-8-before-upgrading-integrations).
