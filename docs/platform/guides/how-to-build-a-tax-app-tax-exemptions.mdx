This section describes how to pass tax exemption details to the tax app from Litium.

Tax exemptions are available in the CustomerInfo.TaxExemption property.

This should be populated during checkout flow, when you create the Litium sales order customer info object.

Following code is in Litium side.

```csharp
await cartContext.AddOrUpdateCustomerInfoAsync(new()
{
    CustomerInfo = new CustomerInfo
    {
        TaxExemptions = new Dictionary<string, string> { { "TaxExemptCertA", "123455" } }
    }
});
await cartContext.CalculateTaxAsync();
```
