Configure and start the containers required by the Litium installation

**Note!** To do this task you first need to complete the [Certificate task](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-certificate).

In this task you will use Docker to start a number of containers running services that are required for Litium to run. More information about these dependencies can be found in the article on [Shared dependencies](/platform/get-started/shared-dependencies).

1.  [Download a copy of docker-compose.yaml](/platform/get-started/shared-dependencies "docker-compose.yaml"). This file also includes containers for SQL Server (for the Litium database) and MailHog (a development SMTP server) which will be used in this guide.
    
2.  Open a terminal or command-window in the directory where you placed the _docker-compose.yaml_\-file
    
3.  Run the command below to start all containers needed to run Litium locally
    
    docker-compose up
    

If you run in to problems during setup see the [Troubleshooting section below](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-setup-docker#troubleshooting).

## Containers

The following containers are started during setup:

   
| **Container** | **Port** | **Related task** | **Info** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dnsresolver | 53 |   | Used as DNS by other containers to let the _localtest.me_\-domain reach out of the container to the host (your computer) |
| Elasticsearch | 9200 | [Configure Litium Search](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-configure-litium-search) | [Litium search on Litium docs](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/architecture/litiumsearch), [Read more about Elasticsearch in docker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.5/docker.html) |
| Synonym server | 9210 | [Configure Litium Search](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-configure-litium-search) | Used by Elasticsearch to store synonyms |
| Kibana | 5601 | [Configure Litium Search](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-configure-litium-search) | Used to browse Elasticsearch index files. [Read more about Kibana in docker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/docker.html) |
| Redis | 6379 | [Configure Redis](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-configure-redis) | [Read more about Redis in docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/uk_faculty_connection/containers-redis-running-redis-on-windows-with-docker) |
| SQL Server | 6379 | [Setup Litium MVC Accelerator](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-setup-litium-mvc-accelerator) | [Read more about SQL Server in docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/multi-container-microservice-net-applications/database-server-container) |
| MailHog | 8025 | [Configure SMTP](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-configure-smtp) | Development/Test SMTP server made available on port 1025 |

## Troubleshooting

| **Error** | **Try this** |
| --- | --- |
| `docker-compose up` fails with error _Bind for 0.0.0.0:6379 failed: port is already allocated_ | Either change ports in the yaml-file or remove the existing container occupying the port (see instructions on how to remove in _Useful docker commands_ below) |
| `docker-compose up` fails | Try moving the `docker-compose.yaml`\-file into a different folder |

If you run in to problems here are three good places to look for information:

1.  Litium event log - found at `\Src\files\logs\litium.log` (created when the application starts so a working setup is required)
2.  Litium Elasticsearch log - found at `\Src\files\logs\elasticsearch.log` (created when the application starts so a working setup is required)
3.  Elasticsearch log in docker - see _Useful docker commands_ below for details on how to read the log

## Useful docker commands

The commands below are useful when working with containers.

### Container listing

Get a list of existing containers (remove `-a` to only get running containers):

docker ps -a

### Read container logs

Run the following command to get logs from the last minute (replace litium-elastic-demo with other container names if needed):

docker logs --since 1m \[pid/name\]

Optionally use the `-f` parameter to get live updates written to the console:

docker logs -f \[pid/name\]

Additional documentation on options for `docker logs` can be found in [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/).

### Stop container

Stop individual container

docker stop litium-redis-demo

Or use the following command to stop all containers by combining the previous commands

docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)

### Start container

Start individual containers

docker start litium-redis-demo

### Remove container

Remove individual container:

docker rm \[pid/name\]

Remove ALL containers:

docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

Remove ALL stopped containers AND ALL unused resources:

docker system prune
