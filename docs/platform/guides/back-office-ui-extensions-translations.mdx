How to translate texts in the administration UI.

Litium uses  [ASP.NET standard localization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/localization?view=aspnetcore-6.0) with translations kept in resource files for display texts in administration UI. To use custom resource file in a project, create a new file under \\_Src\\Litium.Accelerator\\Resources_ folder. Create the folder if it is not available.

Note that when there are multiple resource files containing the same key, the last one will be used.

When working with resource files, the naming is important. It is specified by different parts, _Name\[.culture\].resx_. _Name_ can be whatever you prefer, something that connects it to your add-on. _Culture_ is the culture code for the language, which can be skipped if it is the default/fallback language. 

- _Common.resx_ is the default fallback values. This file probably contains the English translation.
- _Common.sv-se.resx_ is the Swedish translation. If this file does not contain any value, the fallback file is used.

Then add _LitiumLocalization_ tag into _Litium.Accelerator.csproj_ file to include all resource files under _Resources_ folder:

<ItemGroup>
    <LitiumLocalization Include="Resources\\\*.resx" />
</ItemGroup>

The assembly attribute _Litium.Localization.UseAdministrationResource_ should be added in project file to include all resource strings defined by the _LitiumLocalization_\-tag when creating a _IStringLocalizer_ for any class in the project.

<ItemGroup>
    <AssemblyAttribute Include="Litium.Localization.UseAdministrationResource" />
</ItemGroup>

The Accelerator is distributed with all strings for the different areas in a single _.resx_ file in the  \\_Src\\Litium.Accelerator\\Resources_ folder. 

Using resource files in your add-ons makes the installation easier, since no XML files need to be imported into back office. Make sure to use unique names for your strings, for example _SpecialWidgetName,_ if you are building a special widget for the dashboard.

## Usage

\- In the back bffice, there are two options to get a translation:

1.  Use _AsAngularResourceString()_ string extension from Litium.Web.LocalizationExtensions. For example: _"your.resource.key".AsAngularResourceString()_
2.  Inject _IStringLocalizer_ in constructor then use _\_localizer.GetString("your.resource.key​")_

\- Angular components use ngx-translate to handle translation. Please read more about [ngx-translate](http://github.com/ngx-translate/core) [](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core)[here](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core).
