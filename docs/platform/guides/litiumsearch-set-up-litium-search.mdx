How to set up Litium search.

To set up Litium search you need to [download an Elasticsearch package](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).

Elasticsearch does not have any inbuilt UI, only WebAPI. You can use Kibana to review your data.

[How to use Kibana](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/litium-platform/litiumsearch/inspect-search-index)

When setting up Litium, some shared dependencies are set up.

### Plugin for synonyms

Litium requires that the plugin for remote loading of synonyms be installed. Find the [plugin with installation instructions here](https://github.com/bells/elasticsearch-analysis-dynamic-synonym).
