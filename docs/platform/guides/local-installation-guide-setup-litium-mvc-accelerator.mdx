Create the Accelerator solution and deploy a new Bookstore website  

**Note!** To do this task you first need to complete the [Docker task](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-setup-litium-mvc-accelerator)

## Add template and create Accelerator

Additional information related to the installation can be found in the [Accelerators section](/accelerators/mvc/install-litium-accelerator) on Litium Docs.

If you run into problems getting your site up and running see the [Troubleshooting section below](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-setup-litium-mvc-accelerator#troubleshooting).

1.  Create a directory on your computer where you want to keep your site, for example `C:\Temp\LitiumTutorial\`.
    
2.  Start a PowerShell command prompt **in your new directory** and run the commands below:
    
    \# First install the Litium Accelerator template:
    dotnet new --install "Litium.Accelerator.Templates"
    
    # Make sure your new directory is selected:
    cd C:\\Temp\\LitiumTutorial
    
    # Install a new Accelerator site using the Litium Accelerator template
    dotnet new litmvcacc
    

## Configure database

In the previous Docker-task you started a container with _SQL Server_. If you did not modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file you can use [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sv-se/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) to connect the that server with:

- Server name: **127.0.0.1,5434**
- Authentication: **Select _SQL Server Authentication_**
- Login: **sa**
- Password: **Pass@word**

1.  [Create a new empty database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/create-a-database?view=sql-server-ver15#SSMSProcedure) called **LitiumTutorial**
    
2.  Start a powershell prompt in the folder where you have the `Accelerator.sln`\-file and run the commands below to set up the database using the [Litium db-tool](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/get-started/database-management):
    
    ```bash
    # Run database migrations and configure the database
    dotnet litium-db update --connection "Pooling=true;User Id=sa;Password=Pass@word;Database=LitiumTutorial;Server=127.0.0.1,5434;TrustServerCertificate=True"

    # Create a new Litium backoffice admin user in the database with login admin/nimda
    dotnet litium-db user --connection "Pooling=true;User Id=sa;Password=Pass@word;Database=LitiumTutorial;Server=127.0.0.1,5434;TrustServerCertificate=True" --login admin --password nimda
    ```
    
3.  Set the connectionstring in the `appsettings.json`\-file in the Mvc-project:
    
    ```json
    "Litium": {
      "Data": {
        "ConnectionString": "Pooling=true;User Id=sa;Password=Pass@word;Database=LitiumTutorial;Server=127.0.0.1,5434;TrustServerCertificate=True"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Important!** - In "real" projects you should not store sensitive information like this in code, see [safe storage of app secrets in development in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows).
    

## Configure a files directory

Litium needs to store some data on disk (for example image uploads), find the _files_\-setting in `appsettings.json` and set it to:

```json
"Folder": {
  "Local": "../../files"
}
```

This will create a folder called _files_ in the folder where you have the `Accelerator.sln`\-file.

## Configure custom domain

You need to run your site on a custom domain for other Litium Apps to work. Make the changes below to run your site on `bookstore.localtest.me` instead of `localhost`.

By using a `localtest.me`\-domain it is possible to use a custom domain without having to update the windows `hosts`\-file. `Localtest.me` is a public domain that points to localhost. More information can be found at [readme.localtest.me](http://readme.localtest.me/).

Adjust `Litium.Accelerator.Mvc\Properties\launchSettings.json`, replace _localhost_ and _port_ for the property `applicationUrl`:

```json
"applicationUrl": "https://bookstore.localtest.me:5001;http://bookstore.localtest.me:5000"
```

- _localhost_ can actually still be used instead of _bookstore.localtest.me_, only the **port** is needed to connect.
- Setting port to _5001_ makes it possible to reference the site in the coming tasks, if the original random port is used then connections defined in all tasks would have to be modified to match.

## Build, run and deploy

1.  Right-click on the project `Litium.Accelerator.Mvc` and select **Set as startup project**
2.  Press `Ctrl+F5` to build and run
3.  If all goes well the site will start on a 404-page, add **/Litium** to the url to access Litium Backoffice login: [https://bookstore.localtest.me:5001/litium](https://bookstore.localtest.me:5001/litium). If for some reason your page does not start please refer to the [Troubleshooting](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-setup-litium-mvc-accelerator#troubleshooting) section below.
4.  Login to Litium Backoffice using the admin account created earlier **(admin/nimda)**
5.  Open _Control panel (cogwheel in top right corner) > Deployment > Accelerator_
    1.  Set _Name_ to _Bookstore_
    2.  Set _Domain name_ to `bookstore.localtest.me`
    3.  Click **Import**
6.  **​**Wait for a message confirming that the install was successful. Note that an active internet connection is needed to download the installation package.
7.  Your accelerator website has now been created. This means that the following items are also created:
    - A folder in **Media** for the Accelerator media files.
    - An assortment for the Accelerator categories and products.
    - A price list.
    - An inventory.
    - The default B2B buyer roles _Order approver_ and _Buyer._
8.  Navigate to [https://bookstore.localtest.me:5001/](https://bookstore.localtest.me:5001/) to browse the public Accelerator website. Note that the site will not list any products until [Litium Search](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-configure-litium-search) is configured.

**Important!** - Do not rebuild or restart the application while the installation is running, this may leave you with a partial installation. If this happens the easiest/fastest thing to do is to start over.

The import can take a couple of minutes, most of this time is spent importing data into Media. To view progress just open a new tab to [https://bookstore.localtest.me:5001/Litium/UI/media](https://bookstore.localtest.me:5001/Litium/UI/media), on this page you can see number of files increase in real time until it reaches about 350+ files.

## Next step

[Configure Litium Search](https://start.litium.dev/tutorials/installation/setup/litium-search)

## Troubleshooting

- **My application does not start?**
    
    Check the Litium application log if it contains additional information: `\Src\Litium.Accelerator.Mvc\bin\Debug\litium.log` (a tip is to use a tool like [Baretail](https://www.baremetalsoft.com/baretail/) to monitor this file during development).
    
- **I get nuget package errors when I build my solution?**
    
    Validate and re-set your nuget credentials by following the steps below
    
    1.  Login on Litium Docs and navigate to [Accelerator download page](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/previous-versions/download) - if your account has download permissions this page should display a link to download the latest version 7 Accelerator. If the link is not visible please contact [Litium support](mailto:support@litium.com).
    2.  If the link is visible try re-setting your NuGet credentials:
        1.  Close Visual Studio
            
        2.  Remove current credentials using [nuget remove source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-remove-source) by running the command below in a console/terminal:
            
            ```bash
            dotnet nuget remove source Litium
            ```
            
        3.  Re-add the NuGet credentials according to [Litium packages](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/get-started/litium-packages) page.
            
        4.  Open Visual Studio and try again
            
- **I get error `invalid reference format` when I try to run my site**
    
    You might have an invalid path to your solution file, verify that you have no spaces in the full path to your solution file, example:
    - Valid: `c:\mylitiumsite\Accelerator.sln`
    - Invalid: `c:\my litium site\Accelerator.sln`
- **I get error `The line number specified for #line directive is missing or invalid` when I try to run my site**
    
    See [this forum post](https://forum.litium.com/t/getting-line-number-error-after-installing-visual-studio-2022/2302/2) for a solution.
- **Pressing `CTRL+F5` launches my browser but all I see is a 404-page**
    
    This is expected behaviour until you have deployed an Accelerator website, just append _/litium_ to the URL and try again
