In this article we explain how to create a custom page in the backoffice Settings section.

In Litium, the backoffice can be extended to display custom components to serve customer needs. A [custom field type](/platform/guides/data-modelling-how-to-create-custom-field-types) can be created to fulfill the need of entering custom data, using a custom component. A [custom widget](/platform/areas/dashboard/how-to-create-custom-dashboard-widgets) can be created to show information, or a [custom panel](/platform/guides/back-office-ui-extensions-how-to-create-a-custom-panel) can be created in case people want to display information in a shape of a page.

Since Litium 8, you can also create custom pages in Settings. In this example, we will create two pages in Settings and demonstrate the ability to navigate between them.

## Create sample A and Sample B components

Let us start by creating sample components. They contain a heading text and a link to each other component. Please note, for the sake of simplicity, component templates are inlined in the .ts file. In production, it is recommended to have a template in a separated .html file.

// File path: Litium.Accelerator.Administration.Extensions\\src\\AcceleratorExtensions\\components\\sample\\samplea.component.ts
import {
    ChangeDetectionStrategy,
    Component,
} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'samplea',
    template: \`<h1>Sample A</h1>
                <a \[routerLink\]="\['../sampleb'\]">To sample B<a>\`,
    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
})
export class SampleComponentA { }

// File path: Litium.Accelerator.Administration.Extensions\\src\\AcceleratorExtensions\\components\\sample\\sampleb.component.ts
import {
    ChangeDetectionStrategy,
    Component,
} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'sampleb',
    template: \`<h1>Sample B</h1>
                <a \[routerLink\]="\['../samplea'\]">To sample A<a>\`,
    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
})
export class SampleComponentB { }

## Register components and routes

After creating components, we should register them in an Angular module, and register the routes to assign an Url to a component. Let us modify _Litium.Accelerator.Administration.Extensions\\src\\AcceleratorExtensions\\extensions.ts_ to add routes into _appRoutes_ and register components in _declarations._

import { SampleComponentA } from './components/sample/samplea.component';
import { SampleComponentB } from './components/sample/sampleb.component';

const appRoutes = \[
    {
        path: '',
        children: \[
            { path: 'samplea', component: SampleComponentA },
            { path: 'sampleb', component: SampleComponentB },
        \]
    }
\];

@NgModule({
    declarations: \[
        SampleComponentA,
        SampleComponentB,
    \],

That is all we need to do at the client code. Let us move to the next step to register menu items in the left menu of the Settings.

## Register menu items

Under _Litium.Accelerator.Administration.Extensions_, there is a file named _SettingsMenuProvider.cs_. This file defines a list of menus to be added to the left menu in Settings. We should modify the _Children_ field of _MenuModel_ to return our two new pages:

Children = new\[\]
{
    ("/Litium/UI/settings/extensions/AcceleratorExtensions/samplea", "accelerator.setting.search.samplea", true),
    ("/Litium/UI/settings/extensions/AcceleratorExtensions/sampleb", "accelerator.setting.search.sampleb", true),
}

Note:

- The prefix "/Litium/UI/settings/extensions/" is required and should not be changed.
- The next segment, "AcceleratorExtensions" is the module name, which was defined in _Litium.Accelerator.Administration.Extensions\\src\\AcceleratorExtensions\\extensions.ts_, as the class name. The module is registered to Litium using _AngularModuleAttribute_ in _Litium.Accelerator.Administration.Extensions\\Properties\\AssemblyInfo.cs_ and is exposed in _webpack.js_, via _ModuleFederationPlugin_ so it can be accessed by the platform. More information regarding ModuleFederationPlugin: [https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/).
- The last segment, samplea and sampleb, are the paths to components which we have added to _Litium.Accelerator.Administration.Extensions\\src\\AcceleratorExtensions\\extensions.ts_ in [the second step](#register components and routes).
- The second parameter is the translation key, which will be translated to the name of the menu item. We will register the translation keys in the next step.
- The last parameter is the boolean flag to indicate if the menu item should be visible or not.

## Translation

Add these translation keys to _Litium.Accelerator.Administration.Extensions\\Resources\\Administration.resx_ to show the correct text in the menu. Remember to add them to other files to translate them into other languages.

  <data name="accelerator.setting.search.samplea" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sample A</value>
  </data>
  <data name="accelerator.setting.search.sampleb" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sample B</value>
  </data>

## Build and run

Open your favorite command prompt, navigate to the _Src_ folder and execute:

- _yarn run build-extensions:w_ or _npm run build-extensions:w_ to build the client code in watch mode, which does incremental build when code changes. Do this while developing to reduce the build time.
- In production, execute _yarn run prod_ or _npm run prod_.
- Build the solution _Accelerator.sln_.

Now open your browser, navigate to the Settings, you would see two new pages under _Accelerator_. Each page has its own Url, and has links to each other. Try to click on the link to check if the navigation works.

## Link to external page

To add menu items that contain external links, the following items can be added to the _SettingsMenuProvider_:

Children = new\[\]
{
    ("https://www.litium.com", "External link", true),
    ("settings/iframe/" + 
        HttpUtility.UrlEncode(new Uri("https://www.litium.com").AbsoluteUri), 
        "Open in iFrame", true),
}
