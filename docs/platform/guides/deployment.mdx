Different ways to deploy Litium to customer's site.

Customer sites on **dedicated** servers can deploy Litium by [web deploy](#web deploy), [install agent](#install agent), or [manual upload package via SFTP](#manual upload package via sftp).

Customer sites on **shared** servers deploy by [web deploy](#web deploy) or [manual upload package via SFTP](#manual upload package via sftp).

**Note:** Litium does not permit the installation of agents on the shared servers.

### **Web Deploy**

Please find the publishing settings for Web Deploy directly under the customer’s folder: 

The file is named \[customer\]-Prod/QA/Test.Publishsettings.

Please see [Microsoft's deployment documentation for general guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/deployment/quickstart-deploy-aspnet-web-app?view=vs-2019&tabs=azure#publish-to-a-web-site).

### **Install agent**

**Note:** Litium does not permit the installation of agents on the shared servers. Always seek approval from Litium when you want to install software on the server. The request for approval should be sent Litium support, support@litium.com.

When Litium partners choose to install an agent themselves, they will handle configuration and maintenance.

An additional paid service is available for partners who would like Litium's help to set up Octopus. 

### **Manual upload package via SFTP**

Litium partners can do a deployment by manually uploading the packages via SFTP. Note, however, that we do not recommend this as the primary option, since it is not the most efficient way to deploy. 

Shared servers will always have SFTP, but for dedicated servers, Litium only set it up when requested.

If you as a Litium partner wish to have SFTP setup for a customer’s dedicated servers, please contact [Litium support](/resources/support) and specify which servers and folders.
