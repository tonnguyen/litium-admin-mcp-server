Configure the XUnit test project to automatically test Litium business logic.

To do this task you first need to complete the [Setup Litium MVC Accelerator](/platform/guides/local-installation-guide-setup-litium-mvc-accelerator) task.

## Setup

A test-project is included in the Accelerator solution, follow the steps below to configure and add tests.

1.  Copy the database connectionstring from `appsettings.json` of the MVC-project to `appsettings.json` in the test project
    
2.  Open the _Test Explorer_ window in _Visual Studio_ and click _Run all tests_
    
3.  Log files that get updated during test runs are available in folder: `\Test\Litium.Accelerator.Test\bin\Debug\`
    
4.  Detailed information about test project setup is available on the [Setting up a test project](https://docs.litium.com/documentation/get-started/setting_up_a_test_project) page.
