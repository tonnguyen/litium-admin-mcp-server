## What is Litium Admin MCP Server?

Litium Admin MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI models with programmatic access to the Litium e-commerce platform's Admin Web API. Built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel, it enables AI assistants like Claude and Cursor to interact with your Litium instance.

## Architecture

The server uses a stateless, header-based authentication model:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[MCP Client] -->|HTTPS + Headers| B[Next.js on Vercel]
    B -->|OAuth2| C[Litium Admin API]
    C -->|JSON Response| B
    B -->|JSON-RPC| A
```

<Info>
  **No Server-Side Storage**: Credentials are passed via HTTP headers with each request. The server never stores your credentials.
