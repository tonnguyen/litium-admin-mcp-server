## Overview

View order information. Operations: search, get (read-only).

<Warning>
  **Limited Search Support:** Order search in the Admin API only supports searching by Order ID/Number. Email-based customer search is NOT supported.
</Warning>

## Operations

- `search` - Search for orders by Order ID/Number
- `get` - Get order by System ID

## Examples

### Search Orders by Order Number

<CodeGroup>
```json JSON-RPC
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "manage_order",
    "arguments": {
      "operation": "search",
      "params": {
        "search": "LS10070",
        "take": 10
      }
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

```text Natural Language
"Find order LS10070"
```
</CodeGroup>

**Result**: Returns exactly 1 order matching "LS10070" ✅

### Get Order by System ID

<CodeGroup>
```json JSON-RPC
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "manage_order",
    "arguments": {
      "operation": "get",
      "systemId": "abc-123-def-456"
    }
  },
  "id": 2
}
```

```text Natural Language
"Show me order abc-123-def-456"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Search Capabilities

<Note>
  **Order ID Search Only**: The Admin API search for orders has limited support and only works with Order ID/Number.
</Note>

- **Order ID/Number Search**: Uses `IdFilterCondition` with contains match
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ "LS10001" - Finds orders with IDs containing "LS10001"
  - ✅ "LS10070" - Finds orders with IDs containing "LS10070"
  - ✅ "LS100" - Finds all orders with IDs containing "LS100"

### How Order ID Search Works

The search uses `IdFilterCondition` with contains operator:

```json
{
  "filter": [
    {
      "$type": "Litium.Data.Queryable.Conditions.IdFilterCondition, Litium.Abstractions",
      "operator": "contains",
      "value": "LS10070"
    }
  ],
  "skip": 0,
  "take": 20
}
```

<Warning>
  **Customer Email Search Not Supported**: The `OrderCustomerFilterCondition` is not available in the Admin API. For advanced order search including customer information, use the Administration Application API instead.
</Warning>
