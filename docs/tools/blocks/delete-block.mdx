    Use [get_block](/tools/blocks/get-block) to confirm you have the correct systemId
    
    ```json
    {
      "systemId": "abc-123-def-456"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Block Usage">
    Ensure the block is not actively used on any pages (check in Litium admin)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Backup (Optional)">
    Save the block data if you might need it later
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delete Block">
    Use `delete_block` with the verified systemId
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    Try to retrieve the block with [get_block](/tools/blocks/get-block) - should return "not found"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Block not found">
    **Cause**: The system ID doesn't exist or was already deleted
    
    **Solution**: Verify the systemId using [search_blocks](/tools/blocks/search-blocks). If the block was already deleted, no action is needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot delete - block in use">
    **Cause**: The block is referenced by active pages
    
    **Solution**: Remove the block from all pages in Litium admin before deleting. Check website pages, templates, and page layouts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied">
    **Cause**: Insufficient permissions to delete blocks
    
    **Solution**: Verify your OAuth2 credentials have delete permissions for blocks. Contact your Litium administrator if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unexpected error">
    **Cause**: Database constraint or system error
    
    **Solution**: Check if the block has dependencies. Review Litium logs for detailed error messages.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Warning>
  **Production deletions**: Always exercise extreme caution when deleting blocks in production environments
</Warning>

<Check>
  **Test in staging**: Test deletion process in staging environment first
</Check>

<Check>
  **Document deletions**: Keep a record of what was deleted and why
</Check>

<Check>
  **Batch carefully**: When deleting multiple blocks, verify each one individually
</Check>

<Check>
  **Archive first**: Consider archiving or exporting block data before deletion
</Check>

## Recovery

<Warning>
  **No undo**: Once deleted, blocks cannot be recovered through the MCP server
</Warning>

If you accidentally delete a block:

1. **Check backups**: Restore from Litium database backups if available
2. **Recreate**: Use [create_block](/tools/blocks/create-block) to recreate the block if you have the data
3. **Contact support**: Reach out to your Litium administrator or support team

## Alternatives to Deletion

Before deleting, consider these alternatives:

- **Archive**: Move block to an "archived" category
- **Disable**: Update block to mark it as inactive
- **Rename**: Update the name to indicate it's deprecated
- **Export**: Save block data for potential future use

Use [update_block](/tools/blocks/update-block) to implement these alternatives.
