<CodeGroup>

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "manage_customer",
    "arguments": {
      "operation": "search",
      "params": {
        "search": "john@example.com",

      }
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

"Find customers with email john@example.com"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Search by Name

<CodeGroup>
```json JSON-RPC
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "manage_customer",
    "arguments": {
      "operation": "search",
      "params": {
        "search": "Smith"
      }
    }
  },
  "id": 2
}
```

```text Natural Language

## Search Capabilities

The customer search uses OR logic to search across multiple fields:
- **Customer ID** - Login/username
- **First Name** - Customer's first name
- **Last Name** - Customer's last name  
- **Email** - Email address
- **Phone** - Phone number

A single search term will match customers if it appears in any of these fields.

<Info>
  Search is case-insensitive and uses "contains" matching, so searching for "john" will find "John", "Johnson", "john@example.com", etc.
